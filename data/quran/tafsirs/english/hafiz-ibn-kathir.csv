<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>
<h2>The Meaning of Al-Fatihah and its Various Names</h2>
<p>This Surah is called</p>
<p>- Al-Fatihah, that is, the Opener of the Book, the Surah with which prayers are begun.</p>
<p>- It is also called, Umm Al-Kitab (the Mother of the Book), according to the majority of the scholars.</p>
<p>In an authentic Hadith recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah <strong style=""color: #5f6368;"">ﷺ </strong>said,</p>
<p>الْحَمْدُ للهِ رَبَ الْعَالَمِينَ أُمُّ الْقُرْآنِ وَأُمُّ الْكِتَابِ وَالسَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
<p>Al-Hamdu lillahi Rabbil-`Alamin is the Mother of the Qur'an, the Mother of the Book, and the seven repeated Ayat of the Glorious Qur'an.It is also called Al-Hamd and As-Salah, because the Prophet ﷺ said that his Lord said,</p>
<p>قَسَمْتُ الصَّلَاةَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي نِصْفَيْنِ، فَإِذَا قَالَ الْعَبْدُ:الْحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، قَالَ اللهُ: حَمِدَنِي عَبْدِي</p>
<p>The prayer (i.e., Al-Fatihah) is divided into two halves between Me and My servants. When the servant says, `All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of existence,' Allah says, 'My servant has praised Me. Al-Fatihah was called the Salah, because reciting it is a condition for the correctness of Salah - the prayer. Al-Fatihah was also called Ash-Shifa' (the Cure).It is also called Ar-Ruqyah (remedy), since in the Sahih, there is the narration of Abu Sa`id telling the story of the Companion who used Al-Fatihah as a remedy for the tribal chief who was poisoned. Later, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to a Companion,</p>
<p>وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّهَا رُقْيَةٌ</p>
<p>How did you know that it is a Ruqyah?Al-Fatihah was revealed in Makkah as Ibn Abbas, Qatadah and Abu Al-Aliyah stated.Allah said,</p>
<p>وَلَقَدْ ءاتَيْنَـكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ الْمَثَانِي</p>
<p>And indeed, We have bestowed upon you the seven Mathani (seven repeatedly recited verses), (i.e. Surah Al-Fatihah) (15:87). Allah knows best.</p>
<h2>How many Ayat does Al-Fatihah contain</h2>
<p>There is no disagreement over the view that Al-Fatihah contains seven Ayat. According to the majority of the reciters of Al-Kufah, a group of the Companions, the Tabi`in, and a number of scholars from the successive generations, the Bismillah is a separate Ayah in its beginning. We will mention this subject again soon, if Allah wills, and in Him we trust.</p>
<h2>The Number of Words and Letters in Al-Fatihah</h2>
<p>The scholars say that Al-Fatihah consists of twenty-five words, and that it contains one hundred and thirteen letters.</p>
<h2>The Reason it is called Umm Al-Kitab</h2>
<p>In the beginning of the Book of Tafsir, in his Sahih, Al-Bukhari said; ""It is called Umm Al-Kitab, because the Qur'an starts with it and because the prayer is started by reciting it."" It was also said that it is called Umm Al-Kitab, because it contains the meanings of the entire Qur'an. Ibn Jarir said, ""The Arabs call every comprehensive matter that contains several specific areas an Umm. For instance, they call the skin that surrounds the brain, Umm Ar-Ra's. They also call the flag that gathers the ranks of the army an Umm."" He also said, ""Makkah was called Umm Al-Qura, (the Mother of the Villages) because it is the grandest and the leader of all villages. It was also said that the earth was made starting from Makkah.""</p>
<p>Further, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah narrated about Umm Al-Qur'an that the Prophet&nbsp;ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«هِيَ أُمُّ الْقُرْآنِ وَهِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَهِيَ الْقُرْآنُ الْعَظِيمُ»</p>
<p>(It is Umm Al-Qur'an, the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an.)</p>
<p>Also, Abu Ja`far, Muhammad bin Jarir At-Tabari recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about Al-Fatihah,</p>
<p>«هِيَ أُمُّ الْقُرْآنِ وَهِيَ فَاتِحَةُ الْكِتَابِ وَهِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي»</p>
<p>(It is Umm Al-Qur'an, Al-Fatihah of the Book (the Opener of the Qur'an) and the seven repeated (verses).)</p>
<h2>Virtues of Al-Fatihah</h2>
<p>Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded in the Musnad that Abu Sa`id bin Al-Mu`alla said, ""I was praying when the Prophet ﷺ called me, so I did not answer him until I finished the prayer. I then went to him and he said, (What prevented you from coming) I said, 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ! I was praying.' He said, (`Didn't Allah say),</p>
<p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اسْتَجِيبُواْ لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ</p>
<p>(O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he () calls you to that which gives you life) He then said,</p>
<p>«لَأُعَلِّمَنَّكَ أَعْظَمَ سُورَةٍ فِي الْقُرْآنِ قَبْلَ أَنْ تَخْرُجَ مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ»</p>
<p>(I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an before you leave the Masjid.) He held my hand and when he was about to leave the Masjid, I said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ! You said: I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an.' He said, (Yes.)</p>
<p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p>
<p>(Al-Hamdu lillahi Rabbil-`Alamin)""</p>
<p>«نَعَمْ هِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنُ الْعَظِيمُ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ»</p>
<p>(It is the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an that I was given.)""</p>
<p>Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p>Also, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ out while Ubayy bin Ka`b was praying and said, (O Ubayy!) Ubayy did not answer him. The Prophet ﷺ said, (O Ubayy!) Ubayy prayed faster then went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ !' He said, (Peace be unto you. O Ubayy, what prevented you from answering me when I called you) He said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ! I was praying.' He said, (Did you not read among what Allah has sent down to me,)</p>
<p>اسْتَجِيبُواْ لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ</p>
<p>(Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he () calls you to that which gives you life) He said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! I will not do it again.' the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«أَتُحِبُّ أَنْ أُعَلِّمَكَ سُورَةً لَمْ تَنْزِلْ لَا فِي التَّورَاةِ وَلَا فِي الْإِنْجِيلِ وَلَا فِي الزَّبُورِ وَلَا فِي الْفُرْقَانِ مِثْلَهَا؟»</p>
<p>(Would you like me to teach you a Surah the likes of which nothing has been revealed in the Tawrah, the Injil, the Zabur (Psalms) or the Furqan (the Qur'an)) He said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ !' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, (I hope that I will not leave through this door until you have learned it.) He (Ka`b) said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ held my hand while speaking to me. Meanwhile I was slowing down fearing that he might reach the door before he finished his conversation. When we came close to the door, I said: O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! What is the Surah that you have promised to teach me' He said, (What do you read in the prayer.) Ubayy said, `So I recited Umm Al-Qur'an to him.' He said,</p>
<p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ فِي التَّورَاةِ وَلَا فِي الْإِنْجِيلِ وَلَا فِي الزَّبُورِ وَلَا فِي الْفُرْقَانِ مِثْلَهَا إِنَّهَا السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي»</p>
<p>(By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! Allah has never revealed in the Tawrah, the Injil, the Zabur or the Furqan a Surah like it. It is the seven repeated verses that I was given.)""</p>
<p>Also, At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«إِنَّهَا مِنَ السَّبْعِ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنِ الْعَظِيمِ الَّذِي أُعْطِيتُهُ»</p>
<p>(It is the seven repeated verses and the Glorious Qur'an that I was given.) At-Tirmidhi then commented that this Hadith is Hasan Sahih.</p>
<p>There is a similar Hadith on this subject narrated from Anas bin Malik Further, `Abdullah, the son of Imam Ahmad, recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from Ubayy bin Ka`b, and he mentioned a longer but similar wording for the above Hadith. In addition, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from Ubayy bin Ka`b who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«مَا أَنْزَل اللهُ فِي التَّورَاةِ وَلَا فِي الْإِنْجِيلِ مِثْلَ أُمِّ الْقُرْآنِ وَهِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَهِيَ مَقْسُومَةٌ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي نِصْفَيْنِ»</p>
<p>(Allah has never revealed in the Tawrah or the Injil anything similar to Umm Al-Qur'an.</p>
<p>It is the seven repeated verses and it is divided into two halves between Allah and His servant.)</p>
<p>This is the wording reported by An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.</p>
<p>Also, Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Jabir said, ""I went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after he had poured water (for purification) and said, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ !' He did not answer me. So I said again, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ !' Again, he did not answer me, so I said again, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ !' Still he did not answer me. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ went while I was following him, until he arrived at his residence. I went to the Masjid and sat there sad and depressed. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came out after he performed his purification and said, (Peace and Allah's mercy be unto you, peace and Allah's mercy be unto you, peace and Allah's mercy be unto you.) He then said, (O `Abdullah bin Jabir! Should I inform you of the best Surah in the Qur'an) I said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ !' He said, (Read, `All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the existence,' until you finish it.)"" This Hadith has a good chain of narrators.</p>
<p>Some scholars relied on this Hadith as evidence that some Ayat and Surahs have more virtues than others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the chapter about the virtues of the Qur'an, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, ""Once, we were on a journey when a female servant came and said, `The leader of this area has been poisoned and our people are away. Is there a healer among you' Then a man whose healing expertise did not interest us stood for her, he read a Ruqyah for him, and he was healed. The chief gave him thirty sheep as a gift and some milk. When he came back to us we said to him, `You know of a (new) Ruqyah, or did you do this before' He said, `I only used Umm Al-Kitab as Ruqyah.' We said, `Do not do anything further until we ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.' When we went back to Al-Madinah we mentioned what had happened to the Prophet ﷺ. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«وَمَا كَانَ يُدْرِيهِ أَنَّهَا رُقْيَةٌ اقْسِمُوا وَاضْرِبُوا لِي بِسَهْمٍ»</p>
<p>(Who told him that it is a Ruqyah Divide (the sheep) and reserve a share for me.)""</p>
<p>Also, Muslim recorded in his Sahih, and An-Nasa'i in his Sunan that Ibn `Abbas said, ""While Jibril (Gabriel) was with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he heard a noise from above. Jibril lifted his sight to the sky and said, `This is a door in heaven being open, and it has never been opened before now.' An angel descended from that door and came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, `Receive the glad tidings of two lights that you have been given, which no other Prophet before you was given: the Opening of the Book and the last (three) Ayat of Surat Al-Baqarah. You will not read a letter of them, but will gain its benefit.""' This is the wording collected by An-Nasa'i (Al-Kubra 5:12) and Muslim recorded similar wording (1:554).</p>
<h2>Al-Fatihah and the Prayer</h2>
<p>Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«مَنْ صَلَى صَلَاةً لَمْ يَقْرَأْ فِيهَا أُمَّ الْقُرْآنِ فَهِيَ خِدَاجٌ ثَلَاثًا غَيْرُ تَمَامٍ»</p>
<p>(Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not read Umm Al-Qur'an, then his prayer is incomplete.) He said it thrice.</p>
<p>Abu Hurayrah was asked, ""When we stand behind the Imam"" He said, ""Read it to yourself, for I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p>
<p>« قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: قَسَمْتُ الصّلَاةَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي نِصْفَيْنِ وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ فَإِذَا قَالَ:</p>
<p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ ، قَالَ اللهُ: حَمِدَنِي عَبْدِي وَإِذَا قَالَ:</p>
<p>الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ، قَالَ اللهُ: أَثْنى عَلَيَّ عَبْدِي، فَإذَا قَالَ:</p>
<p>مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ ، قَالَ اللهُ: مَجَّدَنِي عَبْدِي وَقَالَ مَرَّةً: فَوَّضَ إِلَيَّ عَبْدِي فَإِذَا قَالَ:</p>
<p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ ، قَالَ: هذَا بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ، فَإِذَا قَالَ:</p>
<p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ - صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ ، قَالَ اللهُ: هذَا لِعَبْدِي وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ»</p>
<p>(Allah, the Exalted, said, `I have divided the prayer (Al-Fatihah) into two halves between Myself and My servant, and My servant shall have what he asks for.' If he says,</p>
<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p>(1 In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p>
<p>(2 All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of existence.)</p>
<p>Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.' When the servant says,</p>
<p>الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p>(3 The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p>Allah says, `My servant has glorified Me.' When he says,</p>
<p>مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
<p>(4 The Owner of the Day of Recompense.) Allah says, `My servant has glorified Me,' or `My servant has related all matters to Me.' When he says,</p>
<p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p>
<p>(5 You (alone) we worship, and You (alone) we ask for help.) Allah says, `This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he sought.' When he says,</p>
<p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ - صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p>
<p>(6 Guide us to the straight path.) (7 The way of those on whom You have granted Your grace, not (the way) of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray), Allah says, `This is for My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he asked for.').""</p>
<p>These are the words of An-Nasa'i, while both Muslim and An-Nasa'i collected the following wording, ""A half of it is for Me and a half for My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he asked for.""</p>
<h2>Explaining this Hadith</h2>
<p>The last Hadith used the word Salah `prayer' in reference to reciting the Qur'an, (Al-Fatihah in this case) just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p>وَلاَ تَجْهَرْ بِصَلاتِكَ وَلاَ تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَابْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ سَبِيلاً</p>
<p>(And offer your Salah (prayer) neither aloud nor in a low voice, but follow a way between.) meaning, with your recitation of the Qur'an, as the Sahih related from Ibn `Abbas. Also, in the last Hadith, Allah said, ""I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, a half for Me and a half for My servant. My servant shall have what he asked for."" Allah next explained the division that involves reciting Al-Fatihah, demonstrating the importance of reciting the Qur'an during the prayer, which is one of the prayer's greatest pillars. Hence, the word `prayer' was used here although only a part of it was actually being referred to, that is, reciting the Qur'an. Similarly, the word `recite' was used where prayer is meant, as demonstrated by Allah's statement,</p>
<p>وَقُرْءَانَ الْفَجْرِ إِنَّ قُرْءَانَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</p>
<p>(And recite the Qur'an in the early dawn.Verily, the recitation of the Qur'an in the early dawn is ever witnessed.) in reference to the Fajr prayer. The Two Sahihs recorded that the angels of the night and the day attend this prayer.</p>
<h2>Reciting Al-Fatihah is required in Every Rak`ah of the Prayer</h2>
<p>All of these facts testify to the requirement that reciting the Qur'an (Al-Fatihah) in the prayer is required, and there is a consensus between the scholars on this ruling. The Hadith that we mentioned also testifies to this fact, for the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«مَنْ صَلَّى صَلَاةً لَمْ يَقْرَأْ فِيهَا بِأُمِّ الْقُرْآنِ فَهِيَ خِدَاجٌ»</p>
<p>(Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not recite Umm Al-Qur'an, his prayer is incomplete.)</p>
<p>Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«لَا صَلَاةَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَقْرَأْ بِفَاتِحَةِ الْكِتَابِ»</p>
<p>(There is no prayer for whoever does not recite the Opening of the Book.)</p>
<p>Also, the Sahihs of Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«لَا تُجْزِئُ صَلَاةٌ لَا يُقْرَأُ فِيهَا بِأُمِّ الْقُرآنِ»</p>
<p>(The prayer during which Umm Al-Qur'an is not recited is invalid.)</p>
<p>There are many other Hadiths on this subject. Therefore, reciting the Opening of the Book, during the prayer by the Imam and those praying behind him, is required in every prayer, and in every Rak`ah.</p>
<h2>The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</h2>
<p>Allah said,</p>
<p>خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِض عَنِ الْجَـهِلِينَ - وَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
<p>(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don't punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p>ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ - وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيـطِينِ - وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ</p>
<p>(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: ""My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me."") (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p>وَلاَ تَسْتَوِى الْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ السَّيِّئَةُ ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ - وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ - وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p>
<p>(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ﷺ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man's father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p>يَـبَنِى آدَمَ لاَ يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ كَمَآ أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ</p>
<p>(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents Adam and Hawwa' (Eve) out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَـنَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوّاً إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُواْ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ</p>
<p>(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p>أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِى وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ بِئْسَ لِلظَّـلِمِينَ بَدَلاً</p>
<p>(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p>The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p>فَبِعِزَّتِكَ لأغْوِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ إِلاَّ عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ الْمُخْلَصِينَ</p>
<p>(""By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism)."") (38:82-83)</p>
<p>Also, Allah said,</p>
<p>فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ الرَّجِيمِ</p>
<p>إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ - إِنَّمَا سُلْطَـنُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p>(So when you want to recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>
<h2>Seeking Refuge before reciting the Qur'an</h2>
<p>Allah said,</p>
<p>فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ الرَّجِيمِ</p>
<p>(So when you want to recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).) meaning, before you recite the Qur'an. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p>إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلوةِ فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ</p>
<p>(When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms)) (5:6) meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, ""When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir (saying ""Allahu Akbar""; Allah is Greater) and would then supplicate,</p>
<p>«سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، وَتَبَارَكَ اسْمُكَ، وَتَعَالَى جَدُّكَ، وَلَا إِلَهَ غَيْرُكَ»</p>
<p>(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks. Blessed be Your Name, Exalted be Your sovereignty, and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.)</p>
<p>He would then say thrice,</p>
<p>«لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ»</p>
<p>(There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,).</p>
<p>He would then say,</p>
<p>«أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ مِنْ هَمْزَهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِهِ»</p>
<p>(I seek refuge with Allah, the Hearing, the Knowing, from the cursed Satan, from his coercion, lures to arrogance and poems.).""</p>
<p>The four collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi considered the most famous Hadith on this subject.</p>
<p>Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said that his father said, ""When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ started the prayer, he said,</p>
<p>«اللهُ أَكْبَرُ كَبِيرًا ثَلَاثًا الْحَمْدُ للهِ كَثِيرًا ثَلَاثًا سُبْحَانَ اللهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا ثَلَاثًا اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِهِ»</p>
<p>(Allah is the Greater, truly the Greatest (thrice); all praise is due to Allah always (thrice); and all praise is due to Allah day and night (thrice). O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed Satan, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)."" `Amr said, ""The Hamz means asphyxiation, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry."" Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الشَّيطَانِ الرَجِيمِ وَهَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِهِ»</p>
<p>(O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</p>
<p>He said, ""The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.""</p>
<h2>Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</h2>
<p>In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, ""Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«إِنِّي لَأَعْلَمُ شَيْئًا لَوْ قَالَهُ لَذَهَبَ عَنْهُ مَا يَجِدُ: أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</p>
<p>(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.')""</p>
<p>An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p>
<p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, ""Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,</p>
<p>«إِنِّي لَأَعْلَمُ كَلِمَةً لَوْ قَالَهَا لَذَهَبَ عَنْهُ مَا يَجِدُ، لَوْ قَالَ: أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</p>
<p>(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.') They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is saying' He said, `I am not insane.""' Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p>There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p>
<h2>Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</h2>
<p>The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur'an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata' bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur'an. In support of `Ata's statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p>
<p>فَاسْتَعِذْ</p>
<p>(Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is necessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, ""I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil."" Then this will suffice.</p>
<h2>Virtues of the Isti`adhah</h2>
<p>The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah's help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant's meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur'an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p>
<p>إِنَّ عِبَادِى لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـنٌ وَكَفَى بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلاً</p>
<p>(Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).</p>
<p>We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy - Satan - become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy - disbelievers - gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p>
<h2>What does Isti`adhah mean</h2>
<p>Isti`adhah means, ""I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from."" Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p>خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِض عَنِ الْجَـهِلِينَ</p>
<p>(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don't punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p>This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p>وَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
<p>(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p>Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu'minun,</p>
<p>ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ - وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيـطِينِ - وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ</p>
<p>(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: ""My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me."" (23:96-98).)</p>
<p>Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p>وَلاَ تَسْتَوِى الْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ السَّيِّئَةُ ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ - وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ - وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p>
<p>(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<h2>Why the Devil is called Shaytan</h2>
<p>In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned'), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, ""The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,' when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan)."" Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan'. Allah said,</p>
<p>وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نِبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً شَيَـطِينَ الإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ يُوحِى بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُوراً</p>
<p>(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).</p>
<p>In addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«يَا أَبَا ذَرَ تَعَوَّذْ بِاللهِ مِنْ شَيَاطِينِ الْإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ»</p>
<p>(O Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, ""I asked him , `Are there human devils' He said, (Yes.)"" Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«يَقْطَعُ الصَّلَاةَ الْمَرْأَةُ وَالْحِمَارُ وَالْكَلْبُ الْأَسْوَدُ»</p>
<p>(The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).) Abu Dharr said, ""I said, `What is the difference between the black dog and the red or yellow dog' He said,</p>
<p>«الْكَلْبُ الْأَسْوَدُ شَيْطَانٌ»</p>
<p>(The black dog is a devil.).""</p>
<p>Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, ""By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart."" This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators.</p>
<h2>The Meaning of Ar-Rajim</h2>
<p>Ar-Rajim means, being expelled from all types of righteousness. Allah said,</p>
<p>وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ</p>
<p>(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps Rujuman (as missiles) to drive away the Shayatin (devils)) (67:5).</p>
<p>Allah also said,</p>
<p>إِنَّا زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِزِينَةٍ الْكَوَكِبِ - وَحِفْظاً مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ - لاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى وَيُقْذَفُونَ مِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ - دُحُوراً وَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ - إِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ</p>
<p>(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness) (37:6-10).</p>
<p>Further, Allah said,</p>
<p>وَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ</p>
<p>(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18).</p>
<p>There are several similar Ayat. It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people's hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.</p>
<h2>Bismillah is the First Ayah of Al-Fatihah</h2>
<p>The Companions started the Book of Allah with Bismillah:</p>
<p>The scholars also agree that Bismillah is a part of an Ayah in Surat An-Naml (chapter 27). They disagree over whether it is a separate Ayah before every Surah, or if it is an Ayah, or a part of an Ayah, included in every Surah where the Bismillah appears in its beginning. Ad-Daraqutni also recorded a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet that supports this Hadith by Ibn Khuzaymah. Also, similar statements were attributed to `Ali, Ibn `Abbas and others.</p>
<p>The opinion that Bismillah is an Ayah of every Surah, except Al-Bara'ah (chapter 9), was attributed to (the Companions) Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abu Hurayrah and `Ali. This opinion was also attributed to the Tabi`in: `Ata', Tawus, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Makhul and Az-Zuhri. This is also the view of `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad bin Hanbal, (in one report from him) Ishaq bin Rahwayh and Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Salam. On the other hand, Malik, Abu Hanifah and their followers said that Bismillah is not an Ayah in Al-Fatihah or any other Surah. Dawud said that it is a separate Ayah in the beginning of every Surah, not part of the Surah itself, and this opinion was also attributed to Ahmad bin Hanbal.</p>
<h2>Basmalah aloud in the Prayer</h2>
<p>As for Basmalah aloud during the prayer, those who did not agree that it is a part of Al-Fatihah, state that the Basmalah should not be aloud. The scholars who stated that Bismillah is a part of every Surah (except chapter 9) had different opinions; some of them, such as Ash-Shafi`i, said that one should recite Bismillah with Al-Fatihah aloud. This is also the opinion of many among the Companions, the Tabi`in and the Imams of Muslims from the Salaf and the later generations. For instance, this is the opinion of Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mu`awiyah, `Umar and `Ali - according to Ibn `Abdul-Barr and Al-Bayhaqi. Also, the Four Khalifahs - as Al-Khatib reported - were said to have held this view although the report from them is contradicted. The Tabi`in scholars who gave this Tafsir include Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Abu Qilabah, Az-Zuhri, `Ali bin Al-Hasan, his son Muhammad, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Ata', Tawus, Mujahid, Salim, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin `Amr bin Hazm, Abu Wa'il, Ibn Sirin, Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, `Ali bin `Abdullah bin `Abbas, his son Muhammad, Nafi` the freed slave of Ibn `Umar, Zayd bin Aslam, `Umar bin `Abdul-Aziz, Al-Azraq bin Qays, Habib bin Abi Thabit, Abu Ash-Sha`tha', Makhul and `Abdullah bin Ma`qil bin Muqarrin. Also, Al-Bayhaqi added `Abdullah bin Safwan, and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah to this list. In addition, Ibn `Abdul-Barr added `Amr bin Dinar.</p>
<p>The proof that these scholars relied on is that, since Bismillah is a part of Al-Fatihah, it should be recited aloud like the rest of Al-Fatihah. Also, An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan, Ibn Hibban and Ibn Khuzaymah in their Sahihs and Al-Hakim in the Mustadrak, that Abu Hurayrah once performed the prayer and recited Bismillah aloud. After he finished the prayer, he said, ""Among you, I perform the prayer that is the closest to the prayer of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ."" Ad-Daraqutni, Al-Khatib and Al-Bayhaqi graded this Hadith Sahih Furthermore, in Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that Anas bin Malik was asked about the recitation of the Prophet . He said, ""His recitation was unhurried."" He then demonstrated that and recited, while lengthening the recitation of Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, Also, in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, the Sunan of Abu Dawud, the Sahih of Ibn Hibban and the Mustadrak of Al-Hakim - it is recorded that Umm Salamah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to distinguish each Ayah during his recitation,</p>
<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
<p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Owner of the Day of Recompense.)""</p>
<p>Ad-Daraqutni graded the chain of narration for this Hadith Sahih Furthermore, Imam Abu `Abdullah Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, recorded that Mu`awiyah led the prayer in Al-Madinah and did not recite the Bismillah. The Muhajirin who were present at that prayer criticized that. When Mu`awiyah led the following prayer, he recited the Bismillah aloud.</p>
<p>The Hadiths mentioned above provide sufficient proof for the opinion that the Bismillah is recited aloud. As for the opposing evidences and the scientific analysis of the narrations mentioned their weaknesses or otherwise it is not our desire to discuss this subject at this time.</p>
<p>Other scholars stated that the Bismillah should not be recited aloud in the prayer, and this is the established practice of the Four Khalifahs, as well as `Abdullah bin Mughaffal and several scholars among the Tabi`in and later generations. It is also the Madhhab (view) of Abu Hanifah, Ath-Thawri and Ahmad bin Hanbal.</p>
<p>Imam Malik stated that the Bismillah is not recited aloud or silently. This group based their view upon what Imam Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to start the prayer by reciting the Takbir (Allahu Akbar; Allah is Greater) and then recite,</p>
<p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p>
<p>(All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.) (Ibn Abi Hatim 1:12).</p>
<p>Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""I prayed behind the Prophet ﷺ, Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman and they used to start their prayer with,</p>
<p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p>
<p>(All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.)</p>
<p>Muslim added, ""And they did not mention,</p>
<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
<p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) whether in the beginning or the end of the recitation."" Similar is recorded in the Sunan books from `Abdullah bin Mughaffal, may Allah be pleased with him.</p>
<p>These are the opinions held by the respected Imams, and their statements are similar in that they agree that the prayer of those who recite Al-Fatihah aloud or in secret is correct. All the favor is from Allah.</p>
<h2>The Virtue of Al-Fatihah</h2>
<p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad, that a person who was riding behind the Prophet ﷺ said, ""The Prophet's animal tripped, so I said, `Cursed Shaytan.' The Prophet said,</p>
<p>«لَا تَقُلْ: تَعِسَ الشَّيْطَانُ، فَإِنَّكَ إِذَا قُلْتَ: تَعِسَ الشَّيْطَانُ، تَعَاظَمَ وَقَالَ: بِقُوَّتِي صَرَعْتُهُ، وَإِذَا قُلْتَ: بِاسْمِ اللهِ تَصَاغَرَ حَتى يَصِيرَ مِثْلَ الذُبَابِ»</p>
<p>(Do not say, 'Cursed Shaytan,' for if you say these words, Satan becomes arrogant and says, 'With my strength I made him fall.' When you say, 'Bismillah,' Satan will become as small as a fly.)</p>
<p>Further, An-Nasa'i recorded in his book Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and also Ibn Marduwyah in his Tafsir that Usamah bin `Umayr said, ""I was riding behind the Prophet ﷺ..."" and he mentioned the rest of the above Hadith. The Prophet ﷺ said in this narration,</p>
<p>«لَا تَقُلْ هكَذَا فَإِنَّهُ يَتَعَاظَمُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالْبَيْتِ، وَلكِنْ قُلْ: بِسْمِ اللهِ، فَإنَّهُ يَصْغَرُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالذُبَابَةِ»</p>
<p>(Do not say these words, because then Satan becomes larger; as large as a house. Rather, say, 'Bismillah,' because Satan then becomes as small as a fly.)</p>
<p>This is the blessing of reciting Bismillah.</p>
<h2>Basmalah is recommended before performing any Deed</h2>
<p>Basmalah (reciting Bismillah) is recommended before starting any action or deed. For instance, Basmalah is recommended before starting a Khutbah (speech).</p>
<p>The Basmalah is also recommended before one enters the place where he wants to relieve himself, there is a Hadith concerning this practice. Further, Basmalah is recommended at the beginning of ablution, for Imam Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded that Abu Hurayrah, Sa`id bin Zayd and Abu Sa`id narrated from the Prophet ﷺ,</p>
<p>«لَا وُضُوءَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ»</p>
<p>(There is no valid ablution for he who did not mention Allah's Name in it.)</p>
<p>This Hadith is Hasan (good). Also, the Basmalah is recommended before eating, for Muslim recorded in his Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to `Umar bin Abi Salamah while he was a child under his care,</p>
<p>«قُلْ بِسْمِ اللهِ وَكُلْ بِيَمِينِكَ وَكُلْ مِمَّا يَلِيكَ»</p>
<p>(Say Bismillah, eat with your right hand and eat from whatever is next to you.)</p>
<p>Some of the scholars stated that Basmalah before eating is obligatory. Basmalah before having sexual intercourse is also recommended. The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَهْلَهُ قَالَ: بِسْمِ اللهِ اللَهُمَّ جَنِّبْنَا الشَّيْطَانَ وَجَنِّبِ الشَّيْطَانَ مَا رَزَقْتَنَا،فَإنَّهُ إِنْ يُقَدَّرْ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَدٌ لَمْ يَضُرَّهُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَبَدًا»</p>
<p>(If anyone of you before having sexual relations with his wife says, 'In the Name of Allah. O Allah! Protect us from Satan and also protect what you grant us (meaning the coming offspring) from Satan,' and if it is destined that they should have a child then, Satan will never be able to harm that child.)</p>
<h2>The Meaning of ""Allah""</h2>
<p>Allah is the Name of the Lord, the Exalted. It is said that Allah is the Greatest Name of Allah, because it is referred to when describing Allah by the various attributes. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p>هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ الرَّحِيمُ - هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلَـمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ الْعَزِيزُ الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ - هُوَ اللَّهُ الْخَـلِقُ الْبَارِىءُ الْمُصَوِّرُ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p>
<p>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the King, the Holy, the One free from all defects, the Giver of security, the Watcher over His creatures, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Supreme. Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise) (59:22-24).</p>
<p>Hence, Allah mentioned several of His Names as Attributes for His Name Allah. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p>وَللَّهِ الأَسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا</p>
<p>(And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them) (7:180), and,</p>
<p>قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءَ الْحُسْنَى</p>
<p>(Say (O Muhammad ﷺ :) ""Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Gracious (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names."") (17:110)</p>
<p>Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«إِنَّ للهِ تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا، مِائَةً إِلَا وَاحِدًا، مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ»</p>
<p>(Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred minus one, whoever counts (and preserves) them, will enter Paradise.)</p>
<p>These Names were mentioned in a Hadith recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, and there are several differences between these two narrations.</p>
<h2>The Meaning of Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim - the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</h2>
<p>Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim are two names derived from Ar-Rahmah (the mercy), but Rahman has more meanings that pertain to mercy than Ar-Rahim. There is a statement by Ibn Jarir that indicates that there is a consensus on this meaning. Further, Al-Qurtubi said, ""The proof that these names are derived (from Ar-Rahmah), is what At-Tirmidhi recorded - and graded Sahih from `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p>
<p>«قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى: أَنَا الرَّحْمنُ خَلَقْتُ الرَّحِمَ وَشَقَقْتُ لَهَا اسْمًا مِنِ اسْمِي، فَمَنْ وَصَلَهَا وَصَلْتُهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَها قَطَعْتُهُ»</p>
<p>(Allah the Exalted said, 'I Am Ar-Rahman. I created the Raham (womb, i.e. family relations) and derived a name for it from My Name. Hence, whoever keeps it, I will keep ties to him, and whoever severs it, I will sever ties with him.') He then said, ""This is a text that indicates the derivation."" He then said, ""The Arabs denied the name Ar-Rahman, because of their ignorance about Allah and His attributes.""</p>
<p>Al-Qurtubi said, ""It was said that both Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim have the same meaning, such as the words Nadman and Nadim, as Abu `Ubayd has stated. Abu `Ali Al-Farisi said, `Ar-Rahman, which is exclusively for Allah, is a name that encompasses every type of mercy that Allah has. Ar-Rahim is what effects the believers, for Allah said,</p>
<p>وَكَانَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيماً</p>
<p>(And He is ever Rahim (merciful) to the believers.)' (33:43) Also, Ibn `Abbas said - about Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, `They are two soft names, one of them is softer than the other (meaning it carries more implications of mercy).""'</p>
<p>Ibn Jarir said; As-Surri bin Yahya At-Tamimi narrated to me that `Uthman bin Zufar related that Al-`Azrami said about Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, ""He is Ar-Rahman with all creation and Ar-Rahim with the believers."" Hence. Allah's statements,</p>
<p>ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ الرَّحْمَـنُ</p>
<p>(Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty), Ar-Rahman) (25:59),) and,</p>
<p>الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى</p>
<p>(Ar-Rahman (Allah) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty).) (20:5)</p>
<p>Allah thus mentioned the Istawa - rising over the Throne - along with His Name Ar-Rahman, to indicate that His mercy encompasses all of His creation. Allah also said,</p>
<p>وَكَانَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيماً</p>
<p>(And He is ever Rahim (merciful) to the believers), thus encompassing the believers with His Name Ar-Rahim. They said, ""This testifies to the fact that Ar-Rahman carries a broader scope of meanings pertaining to the mercy of Allah with His creation in both lives. Meanwhile, Ar-Rahim is exclusively for the believers."" Yet, we should mention that there is a supplication that reads,</p>
<p>«رَحْمنَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ وَرَحِيمَهُمَا»</p>
<p>(The Rahman and the Rahim of this life and the Hereafter)</p>
<p>Allah's Name Ar-Rahman is exclusively His. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p>قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءَ الْحُسْنَى</p>
<p>(Say (O Muhammad ﷺ ): ""Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names) (17:110),) and,</p>
<p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p>
<p>(And ask (O Muhammad ﷺ ) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: ""Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides Ar-Rahman (Most Gracious, Allah)"") (43:45).</p>
<p>Further, when Musaylimah the Liar called himself the Rahman of Yamamah, Allah made him known by the name `Liar' and exposed him. Hence, whenever Musaylimah is mentioned, he is described as `the Liar'. He became an example for lying among the residents of the cities and villages and the residents of the deserts, the bedouins.</p>
<p>Therefore, Allah first mentioned His Name - Allah - that is exclusively His and described this Name by Ar-Rahman, which no one else is allowed to use, just as Allah said,</p>
<p>قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءَ الْحُسْنَى</p>
<p>(Say (O Muhammad ﷺ): ""Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names."") (17:110)</p>
<p>Only Musaylimah and those who followed his misguided ways described Musaylimah by Ar-Rahman.</p>
<p>As for Allah's Name Ar-Rahim, Allah has described others by it. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p>لَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُمْ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p>
<p>(Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ ) from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad ﷺ) is anxious over you (to be rightly guided) for the believers (he is) kind (full of pity), and Rahim (merciful)) (9:128).</p>
<p>Allah has also described some of His creation using some of His other Names. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p>إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَـهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً</p>
<p>(Verily, We have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer (Sami`) and seer (Basir) (76:2).</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are several of Allah's Names that are used as names for others besides Allah. Further, some of Allah's Names are exclusive for Allah alone, such as Allah, Ar-Rahman, Al-Khaliq (the Creator), Ar-Raziq (the Sustainer), and so forth.</p>
<p>Hence, Allah started the Tasmiyah (meaning, `In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious Most Merciful') with His Name, Allah, and described Himself as Ar-Rahman, (Most Gracious) which is softer and more general than Ar-Rahim. The most honorable Names are mentioned first, just as Allah did here.</p>
<p>A Hadith narrated by Umm Salamah stated that the recitation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was slow and clear, letter by letter,</p>
<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p>
<p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Owner of the Day of Recompense) (1:1-4).</p>
<p>And this is how a group of scholars recite it. Others connected the recitation of the Tasmiyah to Al-Hamd.</p>"
2,"<h2>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</h2><p>Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said, ""The meaning of</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ</p><p>(Al-Hamdu Lillah) (all praise and thanks be to Allah) is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah's innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of. Allah's bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.""</p><p>Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ</p><p>(Al-Hamdu Lillah), that it means, ""A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, `Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.' It was said that the statement,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ</p><p>(All praise and thanks be to Allah), entails praising Allah by mentioning His most beautiful Names and most honorable Attributes. When one proclaims, `All thanks are due to Allah,' he will be thanking Him for His favors and bounties.""</p><h2>The Difference between Praise and Thanks</h2><p>Hamd is more general, in that it is a statement of praise for one's characteristics, or for what he has done. Thanks are given for what was done, not merely for characteristics.</p><h2>The Statements of the Salaf about Al-Hamd</h2><p>Hafs mentioned that `Umar said to `Ali, ""We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah"" `Ali said, ""A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated."" Also, Ibn `Abbas said, ""Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, `My servant has praised Me."" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith.</p><h2>The Virtues of Al-Hamd</h2><p>Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Al-Aswad bin Sari` said, ""I said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! Should I recite to you words of praise for My Lord, the Exalted, that I have collected' He said,</p><p>«أَمَا إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يُحِبُّ الْحَمْدَ»</p><p>(Verily, your Lord likes Al-Hamd.)""</p><p>An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Furthermore, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَفْضَلُ الذِّكْرِ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَفْضَلُ الدُّعَاءِ الْحَمْدُدِلله»</p><p>(The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.)</p><p>At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib. Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا أَنْعَمَ اللهُ عَلَى عَبْدٍنِعْمَةً فَقَالَ: الْحَمْدُ للهِ، إِلَّا كَانَ الَّذِي أَعْطَى أَفْضَلَ مِمَّا أَخَذَ»</p><p>(No servant is blessed by Allah and says,`Al-Hamdu Lillah', except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.) Further, in his Sunan, Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ عَبْدًا مِنْ عِبَادِ اللهِ قَالَ:يَا رَبِّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ كَمَا يَنْبَغِي لِجَلَالِ وَجْهِكَ وَعَظِيمِ سُلْطَانِكَ. فَعَضَلَتْ بِالْمَلَكَيْنِ فَلَمْ يَدْرِيَا كَيْفَ يَكْتُبَانِهَا فَصَعِدَا إِلَى اللهِ فَقَالَا: يَا رَبَّنَا إِنَّ عَبْدًا قَدْ قَالَ مَقَالَةً لَا نَدْرِي كَيْفَ نَكْتُبُهَا، قَالَ اللهُ، وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا قَالَ عَبْدُهُ: مَاذَا قَالَ عَبْدِي؟ قَالَا: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّهُ قَالَ: لَكَ الْحَمْدُ يَا رَبِّ كَمَا يَنْبَغِي لِجَلَالِ وَجْهِكَ وَعَظِيمِ سُلْطَانِكَ. فَقَالَ اللهُ لَهُمَا: اكْتُبَاهَا كَمَا قَالَ عَبْدِي، حَتَّى يَلْقَانِي فَأَجْزِيهِ بِهَا.»</p><p>(A servant of Allah once said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.' The two angels were confused as to how to write these words. They ascended to Allah and said, `O our Lord! A servant has just uttered a statement and we are unsure how to record it for him.' Allah said while having more knowledge in what His servant has said, 'What did My servant say' They said, `He said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.' Allah said to them, `Write it as My servant has said it, until he meets Me and then I shall reward him for it.)</p><h2>Al before Hamd encompasses all Types of Thanks and Appreciation for Allah</h2><p>The letters Alif and Lam before the word Hamd serve to encompass all types of thanks and appreciation for Allah, the Exalted. A Hadith stated,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ كُلُّهُ، وَلَكَ الْمُلْكُ كُلُّهُ، وَبِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ كُلُّهُ، وَإِلَيْكَ يُرْجَعُ الْأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ»</p><p>(O Allah! All of Al-Hamd is due to You, You own all the ownership, all types of good are in Your Hand and all affairs belong to You.)</p><h2>The Meaning of Ar-Rabb, the Lord</h2><p>Ar-Rabb is the owner who has full authority over his property. Ar-Rabb, linguistically means, the master or the one who has the authority to lead. All of these meanings are correct for Allah. When it is alone, the word Rabb is used only for Allah. As for other than Allah, it can be used to say Rabb Ad-Dar, the master of such and such object. Further, it was reported that Ar-Rabb is Allah's Greatest Name.</p><h2>The Meaning of Al-`Alamin</h2><p>Al-`Alamin is plural for `Alam, which encompasses everything in existence except Allah. The word `Alam is itself a plural word, having no singular form. The `Alamin are different creations that exist in the heavens and the earth, on land and at sea. Every generation of creation is called an `Alam. Al-Farra` and Abu `Ubayd said, ""`Alam includes all that has a mind, the Jinns, mankind, the angels and the devils, but not the animals."" Also, Zayd bin Aslam and Abu Muhaysin said, `Alam includes all that Allah has created with a soul."" Further, Qatadah said about,</p><p>رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(The Lord of the `Alamin), ""Every type of creation is an `Alam."" Az-Zajjaj also said, ""Alam encompasses everything that Allah created, in this life and in the Hereafter."" Al-Qurtubi commented, ""This is the correct meaning, that the `Alam encompasses everything that Allah created in both worlds. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَا رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - قَالَ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ</p><p>(Fir`awn (Pharaoh) said: ""And what is the Lord of the `Alamin"" Musa (Moses) said: ""The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty"") (26:23-24).</p><h2>Why is the Creation called `Alam</h2><p>`Alam is derived from `Alamah, that is because it is a sign testifying to the existence of its Creator and to His Oneness.""</p>"
3,"<p>Allah said next,</p><p>الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful)) We explained these Names in the Basmalah. Al-Qurtubi said, ""Allah has described Himself by `Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim' after saying `the Lord of the Alamin', so His statement here includes a warning, and then an encouragement. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>نَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ - وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ ٱلْعَذَابُ ٱلْأَلِيمُ</p><p>(Declare (O Muhammad ﷺ) unto My servants, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) (15:49-50) Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Surely, your Lord is swift in retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (6:165)</p><p>Hence, Rabb contains a warning while Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim encourages. Further, Muslim recorded in his Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ مَا عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنَ الْعُقُوبَةِ مَا طَمِعَ فِي جَنَّتِهِ أَحَدٌ، وَلَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْكَافِرُ مَا عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ مَا قَنَطَ مِنْ رَحْمَتِهِ أَحَدٌ»</p><p>(If the believer knew what punishment Allah has, none would have hope in acquiring His Paradise, and if the disbeliever knew what mercy Allah has, none will lose hope of earning His earning.)</p>"
4,"<h2>Indicating Sovereignty on the Day of Judgment</h2><p>Allah mentioned His sovereignty of the Day of Resurrection, but this does not negate His sovereignty over all other things. For Allah mentioned that He is the Lord of existence, including this earthly life and the Hereafter. Allah only mentioned the Day of Recompense here because on that Day, no one except Him will be able to claim ownership of anything whatsoever. On that Day, no one will be allowed to speak without His permission. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ صَفّاً لاَّ يَتَكَلَّمُونَ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَقَالَ صَوَاباً</p><p>(The Day that Ar-Ruh (Jibril (Gabriel) or another angel) and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious (Allah) allows, and he will speak what is right.) (78:38),</p><p>وَخَشَعَتِ الأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ فَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً</p><p>(And all voices will be humbled for the Most Gracious (Allah), and nothing shall you hear but the low voice of their footsteps.)(20:108), and,</p><p>يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لاَ تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِىٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ</p><p>(On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His (Allah's) leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed) (11:105).</p><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented, ""Allah says, `On that Day, no one owns anything that they used to own in the world.""'</p><h2>The Meaning of Yawm Ad-Din</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas said, ""Yawm Ad-Din is the Day of Recompense for the creatures, meaning the Day of Judgment. On that Day, Allah will reckon the creation for their deeds, evil for evil, good for good, except for those whom He pardons."" In addition, several other Companions, Tabi`in and scholars of the Salaf, said similarly, for this meaning is apparent and clear from the Ayah.</p><h2>Allah is Al-Malik (King or Owner)</h2><p>Allah is the True Owner (Malik) (of everything and everyone). Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلَـمُ</p><p>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the King, the Holy, the One free from all defects) (59:23).</p><p>Also, the Two Sahihs recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَخْنَعُ اسْمٍ عِنْدَ اللهِ رَجُلٌ تَسَمَّى بِمَلِكِ الْأَمْلَاكِ وَلَا مَالِكَ إِلَّا اللهُ»</p><p>(The most despicable name to Allah is a person who calls himself the king of kings, while there are no owners except Allah.)</p><p>Also the Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقْبِضُ اللهُ الْأَرْضَ وَيَطْوِي السَّمَاءَ بِيَمِينِهِ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَنَا الْمَلِكُ، أَيْنَ مُلُوكُ الْأَرْضِ؟ أَيْنَ الْجَبَّارُونَ؟ أَيْنَ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ؟»</p><p>((On the Day of Judgement) Allah will grasp the earth and fold up the heavens with His Right Hand and proclaim, 'I Am the King! Where are the kings of the earth Where are the tyrants Where are the arrogant')</p><p>Also, in the the Glorious Qur'an;</p><p>لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ الْوَحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</p><p>(Whose is the kingdom this Day Allah's, the One, the Irresistible.)(40:16).</p><p>As for calling someone other than Allah a king in this life, then it is done as a figure of speech. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكًا</p><p>(Indeed Allah appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.) (2:247),</p><p>وَكَانَ وَرَآءَهُم مَّلِكٌ</p><p>(As there was a king behind them)(18:79), and,</p><p>إِذْ جَعَلَ فِيكُمْ أَنْبِيَآءَ وَجَعَلَكُمْ مُّلُوكاً</p><p>When He made Prophets among you, and made you kings )5:20(.</p><p>Also, the Two Sahihs recorded,</p><p>«مِثْلُ الْمُلُوكِ عَلَى الْأَسِرَّةِ»</p><p>(Just like kings reclining on their thrones)</p><h2>The Meaning of Ad-Din</h2><p>Ad-Din means the reckoning, the reward or punishment. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ يُوَفِّيهِمُ اللَّهُ دِينَهُمُ الْحَقَّ</p><p>(On that Day Allah will pay them the (Dinahum) recompense (of their deeds) in full) (24:25), and,</p><p>أَءِنَّا لَمَدِينُونَ</p><p>(Shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)) (37:53). A Hadith stated,</p><p>«الْكَيِّسُ مَنْ دَانَ نَفْسَهُ وَعَمِلَ لِمَا بَعْدَ الْمَوتِ»</p><p>(The wise person is he who reckons himself and works for (his life) after death.) meaning, he holds himself accountable. Also, `Umar said, ""Hold yourself accountable before you are held accountable, weigh yourselves before you are weighed, and be prepared for the biggest gathering before He Whose knowledge encompasses your deeds,</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ تُعْرَضُونَ لاَ تَخْفَى مِنكُمْ خَافِيَةٌ</p><p>(That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of yours will be hidden) (69:18).""</p>"
5,"<h2>The Linguistic and Religious Meaning of `Ibadah</h2><p>Linguistically, `Ibadah means subdued. For instance, a road is described as Mu`abbadah, meaning, `paved'. In religious terminology, `Ibadah implies the utmost love, humility and fear.</p><h2>The Merit of stating the Object of the Action before the Doer of the Act, and the Merit of these Negations</h2><p>""You..."", means, we worship You alone and none else, and rely on You alone and none else. This is the perfect form of obedience and the entire religion is implied by these two ideas. Some of the Salaf said, Al-Fatihah is the secret of the Qur'an, while these words are the secret of Al-Fatihah,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(5 You we worship, and You we ask for help from.)</p><p>The first part is a declaration of innocence from Shirk (polytheism), while the second negates having any power or strength, displaying the recognition that all affairs are controlled by Allah alone. This meaning is reiterated in various instances in the Qur'an. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَـفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(So worship Him (O Muhammad ) and put your trust in Him. And your Lord is not unaware of what you (people) do.) (11:123),</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا</p><p>(Say: ""He is the Most Gracious (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust."") (67:29),</p><p>رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً</p><p>((He alone is) the Lord of the east and the west; La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He).</p><p>So take Him alone as Wakil (Disposer of your affairs)), (73:9), and,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(You we worship, and You we ask for help from).</p><p>We should mention that in this Ayah, the type of speech here changes from the third person to direct speech by using the Kaf in the statement Iyyaka (You). This is because after the servant praised and thanked Allah, he stands before Him, addressing Him directly;</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(You we worship, and You we ask for help from).</p><p>So take Him alone as Wakil (Disposer of your affairs)), (73:9), and,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(You we worship, and You we ask for help from).</p><p>We should mention that in this Ayah, the type of speech here changes from the third person to direct speech by using the Kaf in the statement Iyyaka (You).

It is required in every Prayer.</h2><p>The beginning of Surat Al-Fatihah contains Allah's praise for Himself by His most beautiful Attributes and indicates to His servants that, they too, should praise Him in the same manner. Hence, the prayer is not valid unless one recites Al-Fatihah, if he is able. The Two Sahihs recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا صَلَاةَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَقْرَأْ بِفَاتِحَةِ الْكِتَابِ»</p><p>(There is no valid prayer for whoever does not recite Al-Fatihah of the Book.)</p><p>Also, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى : قَسَمْتُ الصَّلَاةَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي نِصْفَيْنِ، فَنِصْفُهَا لِي وَنِصْفُهَا لِعَبْدِي وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ، إِذَا قَالَ الْعَبْدُ:</p><p>«الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبّ الْعَـلَمِينَ يَوْمِ إِنَّ اللَّهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ كَفَرُواْ اللَّهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ غِشَـوَةٌ عَلَى الْمَغْضُوبِ يُنفِقُونَ اللَّهُ سَوَآء قُلُوبِهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ قُلُوبِهِمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ يُوقِنُونَ اللَّهُ بِالْغَيْبِ سَمْعِهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ قُلُوبِهِمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمِ أَمْ اللَّهُ لّلْمُتَّقِينَ قُلُوبِهِمْ بِمَآ اللَّهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِنَّ اللَّهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ كَفَرُواْ اللَّهُ الْمَغْضُوبِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ»</p><p>، قَالَ اللهُ: أَثْنى عَلَيَّ عَبْدِي فَإذَا قَالَ:</p><p>مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ ، قَالَ اللهُ: مَجَّدَنِي عَبْدِي، وَإِذَا قَالَ:</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ ، قَالَ: هذَا بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ عَبْدِي، وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ، فَإِذَا قَالَ:</p><p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</p><p>صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ ، قَالَ: هذَا لِعَبْدِي، وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ»</p><p>(Allah said, `I divided the prayer into two halves between Myself and My servant, one half is for Me and one half for My servant. My servant shall have what he asks for.' When the servant says,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.), Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.' When the servant says,</p><p>الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.' When the servant says,</p><p>مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p><p>(The Owner of the Day of Recompense), Allah says, `My servant has glorified Me.' If the servant says,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(You we worship, and You we ask for help), Allah says, `This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall have what he asked.' If the servant says,</p><p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ - صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p><p>(Guide us to the straight path. The path of those on whom You have bestowed Your grace, not (that) of those who have earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray), Allah says, `This is for My servant, and My servant shall have what he asked.')</p><h2>Tawhid Al-Uluhiyyah</h2><p>Ad-Dahhak narrated that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ</p><p>(You we worship) means, ""It is You whom we single out, Whom we fear and Whom we hope in, You alone, our Lord, and none else.</p><h2>Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah</h2><p>وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(And You we ask for help from), to obey you and in all of our affairs."" Further, Qatadah said that the Ayah,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(You we worship, and You we ask for help from) ""Contains Allah's command to us to perform sincere worship for Him and to seek His aid concerning all of our affairs."" Allah mentioned,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ</p><p>(You we worship) before,</p><p>وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(And You we ask for help from), because the objective here is the worship, while Allah's help is the tool to implement this objective. Certainly, one first takes care of the most important aspects and then what is less important, and Allah knows best.</p><h2>Allah called His Prophet an `Abd</h2><p>Allah called His Messenger an `Abd (servant) when He mentioned sending down His Book, the Prophet's involvement in inviting to Him, and when mentioning the Isra' (overnight journey from Makkah to Jerusalem and then to heaven), and these are the Prophet's most honorable missions. Allah said,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَـبَ</p><p>(All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant (Muhammad ) the Book (the Qur'an)) (18:1),</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ لَّمَا قَامَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ</p><p>(And when the servant of Allah (Muhammad ) stood up invoking Him (his Lord ـ Allah in prayer)), (72:19) and,</p><p>سُبْحَانَ الَّذِى أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً</p><p>(Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) (above all that they associate with Him) Who took His servant (Muhammad ) for a journey by night) (17:1).</p><h2>Encouraging the Performance of the Acts of Worship during Times of Distress</h2><p>Allah also recommended that His Prophet resort to acts of worship during times when he felt distressed because of the disbelievers who defied and denied him. Allah said,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُكَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ - فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَكُنْ مِّنَ السَّـجِدِينَ - وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</p><p>(Indeed, We know that your breast is straitened at what they say. So glorify the praises of your Lord and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him). And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)) (15:97-99).</p><h2>Why Praise was mentioned First</h2><p>Since the praise of Allah, Who is being sought for help, was mentioned, it was appropriate that one follows the praise by asking for his need. We stated that Allah said,</p><p>«فَنِصْفُهَا لِي وَنِصْفُهَا لِعَبْدِي، وَلِعَبْدِي مَا سَأَلَ»</p><p>(One half for Myself and one half for My servant, and My servant shall have what he asked.)</p><p>This is the best method for seeking help, by first praising the one whom help is sought from and then asking for His aid, and help for one's self, and for his Muslim brethren by saying.</p><p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</p><p>(Guide us to the straight path.)</p><p>This method is more appropriate and efficient in bringing about a positive answer to the pleas, and this is why Allah recommended this better method.</p><p>Asking for help may take the form of conveying the condition of the person who is seeking help. For instance, the Prophet Moses said,</p><p>رَبِّ إِنِّى لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَىَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ</p><p>(My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!) (28:24).</p><p>Also, one may first mention the attributes of whoever is being asked, such as what Dhun-Nun said,</p><p>لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(La ilaha illa Anta (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah)), Glorified (and Exalted) be You (above all that they associate with You)! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers) (21:87).</p><p>Further, one may praise Him without mentioning what he needs.</p>"
6,"<p>The Meaning of Guidance mentioned in the Surah</p><p>The guidance mentioned in the Surah implies being directed and guided to success. Allah said,</p><p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</p><p>(Guide us to the straight path) meaning guide, direct, lead and grant us the correct guidance. Also,</p><p>وَهَدَيْنَـهُ النَّجْدَينِ</p><p>(And shown him the two ways (good and evil)) (90:10), means, `We explained to him the paths of good and evil.' Also, Allah said,</p><p>اجْتَبَـهُ وَهَدَاهُ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(He (Allah) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a straight path) (16:121), and,</p><p>فَاهْدُوهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطِ الْجَحِيمِ</p><p>(And lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell)) (37:23). Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, you (O Muhammad ) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the straight path) (42:52), and,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى هَدَانَا لِهَـذَا</p><p>(All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who has guided us to this) (7:43), meaning, guided us and directed us and qualified us for this end - Paradise.</p><h2>The Meaning of As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, the Straight Path.</h2><p>As for the meaning of As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, Imam Abu Ja`far At-Tabari said, ""The Ummah agreed that Sirat Al-Mustaqim, is the clear path without branches, according to the language of the Arabs. For instance, Jarir bin `Atiyah Al-Khatafi said in a poem, `The Leader of the faithful is on a path that will remain straight even though the other paths are crooked."" At-Tabari also stated that, ""There are many evidences to this fact."" At-Tabari then proceeded, ""The Arabs use the term, Sirat in reference to every deed and statement whether righteous or wicked. Hence the Arabs would describe the honest person as being straight and the wicked person as being crooked. The straight path mentioned in the Qur'an refers to Islam.</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«ضَرَبَ اللهُ مَثَلًا صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا، وَعَلَى جَنْبَتَيِ الصِّرَاطِ سُورَانِ فِيهِمَا أَبْوَابٌ مُفَتَّحَةٌ، وَعَلَى الْأَبْوَابِ سُتُورٌ مُرْخَاةٌ، وَعَلَى بَابِ الصِّرَاطِ دَاعٍ يَقُولُ: يَاأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ادْخُلُوا الصِّرَاطَ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَعْوَجُّوا، وَدَاعٍ يَدْعُو مِنْ فَوْقِ الصِّرَاطِ، فَإِذَا أَرَادَ الْإِنْسَانُ أَنْ يَفْتَحَ شَيْئًا مِنْ تِلْكَ الْأَبْوَابِ قَالَ:وَيْحَكَ لَا تَفْتَحْهُ فَإِنَّكَ إِنْ فَتَحْتَهُ تَلِجْهُ فَالصِّرَاطُ: الْإِسْلَامُ وَالسُّورَانِ: حُدُودُ اللهِ وَالْأَبْوَابُ الْمُفَتَّحَةُ مَحَارِمُ اللهِ وَذَلِكَ الدَّاعِي عَلَى رَأْسِ الصِّرَاطِ كِتَابُ اللهِ، وَالدَّاعِي مِنْ فَوْقِ الصِّرَاطِ وَاعِظُ اللهِ فِي قَلْبِ كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ»</p><p>(Allah has set an example: a Sirat (straight path) that is surrounded by two walls on both sides, with several open doors within the walls covered with curtains. There is a caller on the gate of the Sirat who heralds, 'O people! Stay on the path and do not deviate from it.' Meanwhile, a caller from above the path is also warning any person who wants to open any of these doors, 'Woe unto you! Do not open it, for if you open it you will pass through.' The straight path is Islam, the two walls are Allah's set limits, while the doors resemble what Allah has prohibited. The caller on the gate of the Sirat is the Book of Allah, while the caller above the Sirat is Allah's admonishment in the heart of every Muslim.)</p><h2>The Faithful ask for and abide by Guidance</h2><p>If someone asks, ""Why does the believer ask Allah for guidance during every prayer and at other times, while he is already properly guided Has he not already acquired guidance""</p><p>The answer to these questions is that if it were not a fact that the believer needs to keep asking for guidance day and night, Allah would not have directed him to invoke Him to acquire the guidance. The servant needs Allah the Exalted every hour of his life to help him remain firm on the path of guidance and to make him even more firm and persistent on it. The servant does not have the power to benefit or harm himself, except by Allah's permission. Therefore, Allah directed the servant to invoke Him constantly, so that He provides him with His aid and with firmness and success. Indeed, the happy person is he whom Allah guides to ask of Him. This is especially the case if a person urgently needs Allah's help day or night. Allah said,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ءَامِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَـبِ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَـبِ الَّذِى أَنَزلَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ ), and the Book (the Qur'an) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him)) (4:16).</p><p>Therefore, in this Ayah Allah commanded the believers to believe, and this command is not redundant since what is sought here is firmness and continuity of performing the deeds that help one remain on the path of faith. Also, Allah commanded His believing servants to proclaim,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.) (3:8). Hence,</p><p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</p><p>(Guide us to the straight way) means, ""Make us firm on the path of guidance and do not allow us to deviate from it.""</p>"
7,"<p>We mentioned the Hadith in which the servant proclaims,</p><p>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</p><p>(Guide us to the straight way) and Allah says, ""This is for My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he asks for."" Allah's statement.</p><p>صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(The way of those upon whom You have bestowed Your grace) defines the path. `Those upon whom Allah has bestowed His grace' are those mentioned in Surat An-Nisa' (chapter 4), when Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَالصَّـلِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَـئِكَ رَفِيقاً - ذلِكَ الْفَضْلُ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَكَفَى بِاللَّهِ عَلِيماً</p><p>(And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ ), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, the Prophets, the Siddiqin (the truly faithful), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are! Such is the bounty from Allah, and Allah is sufficient to know) (4:69-70).</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p><p>(Not (the way) of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray) meaning guide us to the straight path, the path of those upon whom you have bestowed Your grace, that is, the people of guidance, sincerity and obedience to Allah and His Messengers. They are the people who adhere to Allah's commandments and refrain from committing what He has prohibited. But, help us to avoid the path of those whom Allah is angry with, whose intentions are corrupt, who know the truth, yet deviate from it. Also, help us avoid the path of those who were led astray, who lost the true knowledge and, as a result, are wandering in misguidance, unable to find the correct path. Allah asserted that the two paths He described here are both misguided when He repeated the negation `not'. These two paths are the paths of the Christians and Jews, a fact that the believer should beware of so that he avoids them. The path of the believers is knowledge of the truth and abiding by it. In comparison, the Jews abandoned practicing the religion, while the Christians lost the true knowledge. This is why `anger' descended upon the Jews, while being described as `led astray' is more appropriate of the Christians. Those who know, but avoid implementing the truth, deserve the anger, unlike those who are ignorant. The Christians want to seek the true knowledge, but are unable to find it because they did not seek it from its proper resources.</p><p>This is why they were led astray. We should also mention that both the Christians and the Jews have earned the anger and are led astray, but the anger is one of the attributes more particular of the Jews. Allah said about the Jews,</p><p>مَن لَّعَنَهُ اللَّهُ وَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(Those (Jews) who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath) (5:60).</p><p>The attribute that the Christians deserve most is that of being led astray, just as Allah said about them,</p><p>قَدْ ضَلُّواْ مِن قَبْلُ وَأَضَلُّواْ كَثِيراً وَضَلُّواْ عَن سَوَآءِ السَّبِيلِ</p><p>(Who went astray before and who misled many, and strayed (themselves) from the right path) (5:77).</p><p>There are several Hadiths and reports from the Salaf on this subject. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Adi bin Hatim said, ""The horsemen of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ seized my paternal aunt and some other people. When they brought them to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , they were made to stand in line before him. My aunt said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! The supporter is far away, the offspring have stopped coming and I am an old woman, unable to serve. Grant me your favor, may Allah grant you His favor.' He said, `Who is your supporter' She said, `Adi bin Hatim.' He said, `The one who ran away from Allah and His Messenger' She said, `So, the Prophet ﷺ freed me.' When the Prophet ﷺ came back, there was a man next to him, I think that he was `Ali, who said to her, `Ask him for a means of transportation.' She asked the Prophet ﷺ, and he ordered that she be given an animal.</p><p>"" `Adi then said, ""Later on, she came to me and said, `He (Muhammad ﷺ ) has done a favor that your father (who was a generous man) would never have done. So and-so person came to him and he granted him his favor, and so-and-so came to him and he granted him his favor.' So I went to the Prophet ﷺ and found that some women and children were gathering with him, so close that I knew that he was not a king like Kisra (King of Persia) or Caesar. He said, `O `Adi! What made you run away, so that La ilaha illallah is not proclaimed Is there a deity worthy of worship except Allah What made you run away, so that Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greater) is not proclaimed Is there anything Greater than Allah' I proclaimed my Islam and I saw his face radiate with pleasure and he said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمَغْضُوبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْيَهُودُ وَ إِنَّ الضَّالِينَ النَّصَارَى»</p><p>(Those who have earned the anger are the Jews and those who are led astray are the Christians.)""</p><p>This Hadith was also collected by At-Tirmidhi who said that it is Hasan Gharib.</p><p>Also, when Zayd bin `Amr bin Nufayl went with some of his friends - before Islam - to Ash-Sham seeking the true religion, the Jews said to him, ""You will not become a Jew unless you carry a share of the anger of Allah that we have earned."" He said, ""I am seeking to escape Allah's anger."" Also, the Christians said to him, ""If you become one of us you will carry a share in Allah's discontent."" He said, ""I cannot bear it."" So he remained in his pure nature and avoided worshipping the idols and the polytheistic practices. He became neither a Jew, nor Christian. As for his companions, they became Christians because they found it more pure than Judaism. Waraqah bin Nawfal was among these people until Allah guided him by the hand of His Prophet, when he was sent as Prophet, and Waraqah believed in the revelation that was sent to the Prophet ﷺ may Allah be pleased with him.</p><h2>The Summary of Al-Fatihah</h2><p>The honorable Surah Al-Fatihah contains seven Ayat including the praise and thanks of Allah, glorifying Him and praising Him by mentioning His most Beautiful Names and most high Attributes. It also mentions the Hereafter, which is the Day of Resurrection, and directs Allah's servants to ask of Him, invoking Him and declaring that all power and strength comes from Him. It also calls to the sincerity of the worship of Allah alone, singling Him out in His divinity, believing in His perfection, being free from the need of any partners, having no rivals nor equals. Al-Fatihah directs the believers to invoke Allah to guide them to the straight path, which is the true religion, and to help them remain on that path in this life, and to pass over the actual Sirat (bridge over hell that everyone must pass over) on the Day of Judgment. On that Day, the believers will be directed to the gardens of comfort in the company of the Prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs and the righteous. Al-Fatihah also encourages performing good deeds, so that the believers will be in the company of the good-doers on the Day of Resurrection. The Surah also warns against following the paths of misguidance, so that one does not end up being gathered with those who indulge in sin, on the Day of Resurrection, including those who have earned the anger and those who were led astray.</p><h2>The Bounties are because of Allah, not the Deviations</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(The way of those upon whom you have bestowed Your grace), when He mentioned His favor. On mentioning anger, Allah said,</p><p>غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(Not (that) of those who earned Your anger), without mentioning the subject, although it is He Who has sent down the anger on them, just as Allah stated in another Ayah,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْاْ قَوْماً غَضِبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم</p><p>(Have you (O Muhammad ) not seen those (hypocrites) who take as friends a people upon whom is the wrath of Allah (i.e. Jews)) (58:14).</p><p>Also, Allah relates the misguidance of those who indulged in it, although they were justly misguided according to Allah's appointed destiny. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>مَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</p><p>(He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly-guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead him (to the right path)) (18:17)</p><p>and,</p><p>مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgression) (7:186).</p><p>These and several other Ayat testify to the fact that Allah alone is the One Who guides and misguides, contrary to the belief of the Qadariyyah sect, who claimed that the servants choose and create their own destiny. They rely on some unclear Ayat avoiding what is clear and contradicts their desires. Theirs, is the method of the people who follow their lust, desire and wickedness. An authentic Hadith narrated,</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ»</p><p>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear in it (the Qur'an), then they are those whom Allah has mentioned (refer to 3:7). Hence, avoid them.)</p><p>The Prophet ﷺ was referring to Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـبَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings)(3:7).</p><p>Verily, no innovator in the religion could ever rely on any authentic evidence in the Qur'an that testifies to his innovation. The Qur'an came to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guidance and misguidance. The Qur'an does not contain any discrepancies or contradictions, because it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Worthy of all praise.</p><h2>Saying Amin</h2><p>It is recommended to say Amin after finishing the recitation of Al-Fatihah. Amin means, ""O Allah! Accept our invocation."" The evidence that saying Amin is recommended is contained in what Imams Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded, that Wa'il bin Hujr said, ""I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recite,</p><p>غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p><p>(Not (that) of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray), and he said `Amin' extending it with his voice.""</p><p>Abu Dawud's narration added, ""Raising his voice with it."" At-Tirmidhi then commented that this Hadith is Hasan and was also narrated from `Ali and Ibn Mas`ud. Also, Abu Hurayrah narrated that whenever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite,</p><p>غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p><p>(Not (the way) of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray), He would say Amin until those who were behind him in the first line could hear him.</p><p>Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith with the addition, ""Then the Masjid would shake because of (those behind the Prophet ﷺ) reciting Amin."" Also, Ad-Daraqutni recorded this Hadith and commented that it is Hasan.</p><p>Further, Bilal narrated that he said, ""O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! Do not finish saying Amin before I can join you."" This was recorded by Abu Dawud.</p><p>In addition, Abu Nasr Al-Qushayri narrated that Al-Hasan and Ja`far As-Sadiq stressed the `m' in Amin.</p><p>Saying Amin is recommended for those who are not praying (when reciting Al-Fatihah) and is strongly recommended for those who are praying, whether alone or behind the Imam. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا أَمَّنَ الْإِمَامُ فَأَمِّنُوا، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ وَافَقَ تَأْمِينُهُ تَأْمِينَ الْمَلَائِكَةِ غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ»</p><p>(When the Imam says, ' Amin', then say, 'Amin', because whoever says, Amin' with the angels, his previous sins will be forgiven.)</p><p>Muslim recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا قَالَ أَحَدُكُمْ فِي الصَّلَاةِ: آمِينَ، وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ فِي السَّمَاءِ: آمِينَ، فَوَافَقَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا الْأُخْرَى غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ»</p><p>(When any of you says in the prayer, 'Amin ` and the angels in heaven say, `Amin', in unison, his previous sins will be forgiven.)</p><p>It was said that the Hadith talks about both the angels and the Muslims saying Amin at the same time. The Hadith also refers to when the Amins said by the angels and the Muslims are equally sincere (thus bringing about forgiveness).</p><p>Further, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Musa related to the Prophet ﷺ that he said,</p><p>«إِذَا قَالَ يَعنِي الْإِمَامَ : وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ، فَقُولُوا: آمِينَ، يُجِبْكُمُ اللهُ»</p><p>(When the Imam says, `Walad-dallin', say, `Amin' and Allah will answer your invocation.)</p><p>In addition, At-Tirmidhi said that `Amin' means, ""Do not disappoint our hope"", while the majority of scholars said that it means. ""Answer our invocation.""</p><p>Also, in his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that when the Jews were mentioned to him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُم لَنْ يَحْسُدُونَا عَلَى شَيْءٍ كَمَا يَحْسُدُونَا عَلَى الْجُمُعَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا، وَعَلَى الْقِبْلَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى قَوْلِنَا خَلْفَ الْإِمَامِ: آمِينَ»</p><p>(They will not envy us for anything more than they envy us for Friday which we have been guided to, while they were led astray from it, and for the Qiblah which we were guided to, while they were led astray from it, and for our saying `Amin' behind the Imam.)</p><p>Also, Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith with the wording,</p><p>«مَا حَسَدَتْكُمُ الْيَهُودُ عَلَى شَيْءٍ مَا حَسَدَتْكُمْ عَلَى السَّلَامِ وَالتَّأْمِينِ»</p><p>(The Jews have never envied you more than for your saying the Salam (Islamic greeting) and for saying Amin.) rgiveness). veneooA ? Further, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Musa related to the Prophet ﷺ that he said,</p><p>«إِذَا قَالَ يَعنِي الْإِمَامَ : وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ، فَقُولُوا: آمِينَ، يُجِبْكُمُ اللهُ»</p><p>(When the Imam says, `Walad-dallin', say, `Amin' and Allah will answer your invocation.)</p><p>In addition, At-Tirmidhi said that `Amin' means, ""Do not disappoint our hope"", while the majority of scholars said that it means. ""Answer our invocation.""</p><p>Also, in his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that when the Jews were mentioned to him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُم لَنْ يَحْسُدُونَا عَلَى شَيْءٍ كَمَا يَحْسُدُونَا عَلَى الْجُمُعَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا، وَعَلَى الْقِبْلَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى قَوْلِنَا خَلْفَ الْإِمَامِ: آمِينَ»</p><p>(They will not envy us for anything more than they envy us for Friday which we have been guided to, while they were led astray from it, and for the Qiblah which we were guided to, while they were led astray from it, and for our saying `Amin' behind the Imam.)</p><p>Also, Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith with the wording,</p><p>«مَا حَسَدَتْكُمُ الْيَهُودُ عَلَى شَيْءٍ مَا حَسَدَتْكُمْ عَلَى السَّلَامِ وَالتَّأْمِينِ»</p><p>(The Jews have never envied you more than for your saying the Salam (Islamic greeting) and for saying Amin.)</p>"
8,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madina</h2><h2>Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah</h2><p>The Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah</p><p>In Musnad Ahmad, Sahih Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَجْعَلُوا بُيُوتَكُمْ قُبُورًا فَإِنَّ الْبَيْتَ الَّذِي تُقْرَأُ فِيهِ سُورَةُ الْبَقَرَةِ لَا يَدْخُلُهُ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Do not turn your houses into graves. Verily, Shaytan does not enter the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.) At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih.</p><p>Also, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""Shaytan flees from the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is heard."" This Hadith was collected by An-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak, and then said that its chain of narration is authentic, although the Two Sahihs did not collect it. In his Musnad, Ad-Darimi recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, ""Shaytan departs the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is being recited, and as he leaves, he passes gas."" Ad-Darimi also recorded that Ash-Sha`bi said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""Whoever recites ten Ayat from Surat Al-Baqarah in a night, then Shaytan will not enter his house that night. (These ten Ayat are) four from the beginning, Ayat Al-Kursi (255), the following two Ayat (256-257) and the last three Ayat."" In another narration, Ibn Mas`ud said, ""Then Shaytan will not come near him or his family, nor will he be touched by anything that he dislikes. Also, if these Ayat were to be recited over a senile person, they would wake him up.""</p><p>Further, Sahl bin Sa`d said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ سَنَامًا، وَإِنَّ سَنَامَ الْقُرْآنِ الْبَقَرَةُ، وَإِنَّ مَنْ قَرَأَهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ لَيْلَةً لَمْ يَدْخُلْهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ثَلَاثَ لَيَالٍ، وَمَنْ قَرَأَهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ نَهَارًا لَمْ يَدْخُلْهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّام»</p><p>(Everything has a hump (or, high peek), and Al-Baqarah is the high peek of the Qur'an. Whoever recites Al-Baqarah at night in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three nights. Whoever recites it during a day in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three days.) This Hadith was collected by Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani, Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban in his Sahih and Ibn Marduwyah.</p><p>At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent an expedition force comprising of many men and asked each about what they memorized of the Qur'an. The Prophet ﷺ came to one of the youngest men among them and asked him, `What have you memorized (of the Qur'an) young man' He said, `I memorized such and such Surahs and also Al-Baqarah.' The Prophet said ﷺ, `You memorized Surat Al-Baqarah' He said, `Yes.' The Prophet said ﷺ, `Then you are their commander.' One of the noted men (or chiefs) commented, `By Allah! I did not learn Surat Al-Baqarah, for fear that I would not be able to implement it. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«تَعَلَّمُوا القُرْآنَ وَاقْرَءُوهُ، فَإِنَّ مَثَلَ الْقُرْآنِ لِمَنْ تَعَلَّمَهُ فَقَرَأَ وَقَامَ بِهِ كَمَثَلِ جِرَابٍ مَحْشُوَ مِسْكًا يَفُوحُ رِيحُهُ فِي كُلِّ مَكَانٍ، وَمَثَلُ مَنْ تَعَلَّمَهُ فَيَرْقُدُ وَهُوَ فِي جَوْفِهِ كَمَثَلِ جِرَابٍ أُوكِيَ عَلى مِسْك»</p><p>(Learn Al-Qur'an and recite it, for the example of whoever learns the Qur'an, recites it and adheres to it, is the example of a bag that is full of musk whose scent fills the air. The example of whoever learns the Qur'an and then sleeps (i.e. lazy) while the Qur'an is in his memory, is the example of a bag that has musk, but is closed tight.)</p><p>This is the wording collected by At-Tirmidhi, who said that this Hadith is Hasan. In another narration, At-Tirmidhi recorded this same Hadith in a Mursal manner, so Allah knows best.</p><p>Also, Al-Bukhari recorded that Usayd bin Hudayr said that he was once reciting Surat Al-Baqarah while his horse was tied next to him. The horse started to make some noise. When Usayd stopped reciting, the horse stopped moving about. When he resumed reading, the horse started moving about again. When he stopped reciting, the horse stopped moving, and when he resumed reading, the horse started to move again. Meanwhile, his son Yahya was close to the horse, and he feared that the horse might step on him. When he moved his son back, he looked up to the sky and saw a cloud radiating with light that looked like lamps. In the morning, he went to the Prophet ﷺ and told him what had happened and then said, ""O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! My son Yahya was close to the horse and I feared that she might step on him. When I attended to him and raised my head to the sky, I saw a cloud with lights like lamps. So I went, but I couldn't see it."" The Prophet ﷺ said, ""Do you know what that was"" He said, ""No."" The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْمَلَائِكَةُ دَنَتْ لِصَوْتِكَ وَلَو قَرَأْتَ لَأَصْبَحْتَ يَنْظُرُ النَّاسُ إِلَيْهَا، لَا تَتَوارَى مِنْهُم»</p><p>(They were the angels, they came close hearing your voice (reciting Surat Al-Baqarah), and if you had kept reading, the people would have been able to see the angels when the morning came, and the angels would not be hidden from their eyes.)</p><p>This is the narration reported by Imam Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Salam in his book Fada'il Al-Qur'an.</p><h2>Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah and Surat Al `Imran</h2><p>Imam Ahmad said that Abu Nu`aym narrated to them that Bishr bin Muhajir said that `Abdullah bin Buraydah narrated to him from his father, ""I was sitting with the Prophet ﷺ and I heard him say,</p><p>«تَعَلَّمُوا سُورَةَ الْبَقَرَةِ فَإِنَّ أَخْذَهَا بَرَكَةٌ، وَتَرْكَهَا حَسْرَةٌ، وَلَا تَسْتَطِيعُهَا الْبَطَلَة»</p><p>(Learn Surat Al-Baqarah, because in learning it there is blessing, in ignoring it there is sorrow, and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.)</p><p>He kept silent for a while and then said,</p><p>«تَعَلَّمُوا سُورَةَ الْبَقَرَةِ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ فَإِنَّهُمَا الزَّهْرَاوَانِ، يُظِلَّانِ صَاحِبَهُمَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كَأَنَّهُمَا غَمَامَتَانِ أَوْ غَيَايَتَانِ أَوْ فِرْقَانِ مِنْ طَيْرٍ صَوَافَّ، وَإِنَّ الْقُرآنَ يَلْقى صَاحِبَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ حِينَ يَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ قَبْرُهُ كَالرَّجُلِ الشَّاحِبِ فَيَقُولُ لَهُ: هَلْ تَعْرِفُنِي؟ فَيَقُولُ: مَا أَعْرِفُكَ. فَيَقُولُ: أَنَا صَاحِبُكَ الْقُرْآنُ الَّذِي أَظْمَأْتُكَ فِي الْهَوَاجِرِ وَأَسْهَرْتُ لَيْلَكَ وَإِنَّ كُلَّ تَاجِرٍ مِنْ وَرَاءِ تِجَارَتِهِ، وَإِنَّكَ الْيَوْمَ مِنْ وَرَاءِ كُلِّ تِجَارَةٍ فَيُعْطَى الْمُلْكَ بِيَمِينِهِ وَالْخُلْدَ بِشِمَالِهِ وَيُوضَعُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ تَاجُ الْوَقَارِ، وَيُكْسَى وَالِدَاهُ حُلَّتَانِ لَا يَقُومُ لَهُمَا أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا، فَيَقُولَانِ: بِمَا كُسِينَا هَذَا؟ فَيُقَالُ: بِأَخْذِ وَلَدِكُمَا الْقُرْآنَ ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: اقْرَأْ وَاصْعَدْ فِي دَرَجِ الْجَنَّةِ وَغُرَفِهَا، فَهُوَ فِي صُعُودٍ مَا دَامَ يَقْرأُ هَذًّا كَانَ أَوْ تَرْتِيلًا»</p><p>(Learn Surat Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran because they are two lights and they shade their people on the Day of Resurrection, just as two clouds, two spaces of shade or two lines of (flying) birds.

The Qur'an will ask him, 'Do you know me' The man will say, 'I do not know you.' The Qur'an will say, 'I am your companion, the Qur'an, which has brought you thirst during the heat and made you stay up during the night. Every merchant has his certain trade. But, this Day, you are behind all types of trade.' Kingship will then be given to him in his right hand, eternal life in his left hand and the crown of grace will be placed on his head. His parents will also be granted two garments that the people of this life could never afford. They will say, 'Why were we granted these garments' It will be said, 'Because your son was carrying the Qur'an.' It will be said (to the reader of the Qur'an), 'Read and ascend through the levels of Paradise.' He will go on ascending as long as he recites, whether reciting slowly or quickly.)""</p><p>Ibn Majah also recorded part of this Hadith from Bishr bin Al-Muhajir, and this chain of narrators is Hasan, according to the criteria of Imam Muslim.</p><p>A part of this Hadith is also supported by other Hadiths. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«اقْرَأُوا الْقُرْآنَ فَإِنَّهُ شَافِعٌ لِأَهْلِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ اقْرَأُوا الزَّهْرَاوَيْنِ، الْبَقَرَةَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ، فَإِنَّهُمَا يَأْتِيَانِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كَأَنَّهُمَا غَمَامَتَانِ، أَوْ كَأَنَّهُمَا غَيَايَتَانِ أَوْ كَأَنَّهُمَا فِرْقَانِ مِنْ طَيْرٍ صَوَافَّ، يُحَاجَّانِ عَنْ أَهْلِهِمَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Read the Qur'an, because it will intercede on behalf of its people on the Day of Resurrection. Read the two lights, Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran, because they will come in the shape of two clouds, two shades or two lines of birds on the Day of Resurrection and will argue on behalf of their people on that Day.)</p><p>The Prophet ﷺ then said,</p><p>« اقْرَأُوا الْبَقَرَةَ فَإِنَّ أَخْذَهَا بَرَكَةٌ وَتَرْكَهَا حَسْرَةٌ وَلَا تَسْتَطِيعُهَا الْبَطَلَة»</p><p>(Read Al-Baqarah, because in having it there is blessing, and in ignoring there is a sorrow and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.)</p><p>Also, Imam Muslim narrated this Hadith in the Book of Prayer</p><p>Imam Ahmad narrated that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُؤْتَى بِالقُرْآنِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَأَهْلِهِ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ بِهِ تَقْدَمُهُم سُورَةُ الْبَقَرَةِ وَآلُ عِمْرَان»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection the Qur'an and its people who used to implement it will be brought forth, preceded by Surat Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran.)</p><p>An-Nawwas said, ""The Prophet ﷺ set three examples for these two Surahs and I did not forget these examples ever since. He said,</p><p>«كَأَنَّهُمَا غَمَامَتَانِ، أَوْ ظُلَّتَانِ سَودَاوَانِ بَيْنَهُمَا شَرْقٌ، أَوْ كَأَنَّهُمَا فِرْقَانِ مِنْ طَيْرٍ صَوَافَّ، يُحَاجَّانِ عَنْ صَاحِبِهِمَا»</p><p>(They will come like two clouds, two dark shades or two lines of birds arguing on behalf of their people.)</p><p>It was also recorded in Sahih Muslim and At-Tirmidhi narrated this Hadith, which he rendered Hasan Gharib.</p><h2>Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><p>There is no disagreement over the view that Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in its entirety in Al-Madinah. Moreover, Al-Baqarah was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Al-Madinah, while, Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p><p>(And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.) (2:281) was the last Ayah to be revealed from the Qur'an. Also, the Ayat about usury were among the last Ayat to be revealed. Khalid bin Ma`dan used to call Al-Baqarah the Fustat (tent) of the Qur'an. Some of the scholars said that it contains a thousand news incidents, a thousand commands and a thousand prohibitions. Those who count said that the number of Al-Baqarah's Ayat is two hundred and eighty-seven, and its words are six thousand two hundred and twenty-one words. Further, its letters are twenty-five thousand five hundred. Allah knows best.</p><p>Ibn Jurayj narrated that `Ata' said that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah."" Also, Khasif said from Mujahid that `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said; ""Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah."" Several Imams and scholars of Tafsir issued similar statements, and there is no difference of opinion over this as we have stated.</p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn Mas`ud kept the Ka`bah on his left side and Mina on his right side and threw seven pebbles (at the Jamrah) and said, ""The one to whom Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed (i.e. the Prophet ﷺ) performed Rami (the Hajj rite of throwing pebbles) similarly."" The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith.</p><p>Further, Ibn Marduwyah reported a Hadith of Shu`bah from `Aqil bin Talhah from `Utbah bin Marthad; ""The Prophet ﷺ saw that his Companions were not in the first lines and he said,</p><p>«يَا أَصْحَابَ سُورَةِ الْبَقَرَة»</p><p>(O Companions of Surat Al-Baqarah.) I Think that this incident occurred during the battle of Hunayn when the Companions retreated. Then, the Prophet ﷺ commanded Al-`Abbas (his uncle) to yell out,</p><p>«يَا أَصْحَابَ الشَّجَرَة»</p><p>(O Companions of the tree!) meaning the Companions who participated in the pledge of Ar-Ridwan (under the tree). In another narration, Al- `Abbas cried, ""O Companions of Surat Al-Baqarah!"" encouraging them to come back, so they returned from every direction. Also, during the battle of Al-Yamamah, against the army of Musaylimah the Liar, the Companions first retreated because of the huge number of soldiers in Musaylimah's army. The Muhajirun and the Ansar called out for each other, saying; ""O people of Surat Al-Baqarah!"" Allah then gave them victory over their enemy, may Allah be pleased with all of the companions of all the Messengers of Allah.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p><h2>The Discussion of the Individual Letters</h2><p>The individual letters in the beginning of some Surahs are among those things whose knowledge Allah has kept only for Himself. This was reported from Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthman, `Ali and Ibn Mas`ud. It was said that these letters are the names of some of the Surahs. It was also said that they are the beginnings that Allah chose to start the Surahs of the Qur'an with. Khasif stated that Mujahid said, ""The beginnings of the Surahs, such as Qaf, Sad, Ta Sin Mim and Alif Lam Ra, are just some letters of the alphabet."" Some linguists also stated that they are letters of the alphabet and that Allah simply did not cite the entire alphabet of twenty-eight letters. For instance, they said, one might say, ""My son recites Alif, Ba, Ta, Tha... "" he means the entire alphabet although he stops before mentioning the rest of it. This opinion was mentioned by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>The Letters at the Beginning of Surahs</h2><p>If one removes the repetitive letters, then the number of letters mentioned at the beginning of the Surahs is fourteen: Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad, Ra, Kaf, Ha, Ya, `Ayn, Ta, Sin, Ha, Qaf, Nun.</p><p>So glorious is He Who made everything subtly reflect His wisdom.</p><p>Moreover, the scholars said, ""There is no doubt that Allah did not reveal these letters for jest and play."" Some ignorant people said that some of the Qur'an does not mean anything, (meaning, such as these letters) thus committing a major mistake. On the contrary, these letters carry a specific meaning. Further, if we find an authentic narration leading to the Prophet ﷺ that explains these letters, we will embrace the Prophet's statement. Otherwise, we will stop where we were made to stop and will proclaim,</p><p>ءَامَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا</p><p>(We believe in it; all of it (clear and unclear verses) is from our Lord) (3:7).</p><p>The scholars did not agree on one opinion or explanation regarding this subject. Therefore, whoever thinks that one scholar's opinion is correct, he is obliged to follow it, otherwise it is better to refrain from making any judgment on this matter. Allah knows best.</p><h2>These Letters testify to the Miraculous Qur'an</h2><p>The wisdom behind mentioning these letters in the beginning of the Surahs, regardless of the exact meanings of these letters, is that they testify to the miracle of the Qur'an. Indeed, the servants are unable to produce something like the Qur'an, although it is comprised of the same letters with which they speak to each other. This opinion was mentioned by Ar-Razi in his Tafsir who related it to Al-Mubarrid and several other scholars. Al-Qurtubi also related this opinion to Al-Farra' and Qutrub. Az-Zamakhshari agreed with this opinion in his book, Al-Kashshaf. In addition, the Imam and scholar Abu Al-`Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah and our Shaykh Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Hajjaj Al-Mizzi agreed with this opinion. Al-Mizzi told me that it is also the opinion of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. KAz-Zamakhshari said that these letters, ""Were not all mentioned once in the beginning of the Qur'an. Rather, they were repeated so that the challenge (against the creation) is more daring. Similarly, several stories were mentioned repeatedly in the Qur'an, and also the challenge was repeated in various areas (i.e., to produce something like the Qur'an). Sometimes, one letter at a time was mentioned, such as Sad, Nun and Qaf. Sometimes two letters were mentioned, such as</p><p>حـم</p><p>(Ha Mim) (44:1) Sometimes, three letters were mentioned, such as,</p><p>الم</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim (2: 1)) and four letters, such as,</p><p>المر</p><p>(`Alif Lam Mim Ra) (13:1), and</p><p>المص</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim Sad) (7:1).</p><p>Sometimes, five letters were mentioned, such as,</p><p>كهيعص</p><p>(Kaf Ha Ya `Ayn Sad) (19:1), and;</p><p>حـم - عسق</p><p>(Ha Mim. `Ayn Sin Qaf) (42:1-2).</p><p>This is because the words that are used in speech are usually comprised of one, two, three, four, or five letters.""</p><p>Every Surah that begins with these letters demonstrates the Qur'an's miracle and magnificence, and this fact is known by those well-versed in such matters. The count of these Surahs is twenty-nine. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>الم ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim) This is the Book (the Qur'an), wherein there is no doubt (2:1-2),</p><p>الم - اللهُ لا إلَهَ إلاَّ هُوَ اَلْحَيُّ القَيُّومُ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَٰـبَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyuum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you (Muhammad ) with truth, confirming what came before it.) (3:1-3), and,</p><p>المص كِتَٰـبٌ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلاَ يَكُن فِى صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِّنْهُ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim Sad. (This is the) Book (the Qur'an) sent down unto you (O Muhammad ), so let not your breast be narrow therefrom) (7:1-2).</p><p>Also, Allah said,</p><p>الر كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَٰـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad ) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into the light (of belief in the Oneness of Allah and Islamic Monotheism) by their Lord's leave) (14:1),</p><p>الم -&nbsp;تَنْزِيلُ الْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ&nbsp;مِن رَّبِّ الْعَالَمينَ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of the Book (this Qur'an) in which there is no doubt, is from the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)!) (32:1-2),</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(Ha Mim. A revelation from (Allah) the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) (41:1-2), and,</p><p>حـم - عسق- كَذَٰلِكَ يُوحِي إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى اَلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ اللهُ اَلْعَزِيزُ اَلْحَكَيمُ</p><p>(Ha Mim. `Ain Sin Qaf. Likewise Allah, the Almighty, the Wise sends revelation to you (O Muhammad ) as (He sent revelation to) those before you.) (42:1-3).</p><p>There are several other Ayat that testify to what we have mentioned above, and Allah knows best.</p>"
9,"<h2>There is no Doubt in the Qur'an</h2><p>The Book, is the Qur'an, and Rayb means doubt. As-Suddi said that Abu Malik and Abu Salih narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and Murrah Al-Hamadani narrated from Ibn Mas`ud and several other Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ that,</p><p>لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p>(In which there is no Rayb), means about which there is no doubt. Abu Ad-Darda', Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Nafi` `Ata', Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Isma`il bin Abi Khalid said similarly. In addition, Ibn Abi Hatim said, ""I do not know of any disagreement over this explanation."" The meaning of this is that the Book, the Qur'an, is without a doubt revealed from Allah. Similarly, Allah said in Surat As- Sajdah,</p><p>الم - ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim). The revelation of the Book (this Qur'an) in which there is no doubt, is from the Lord of all that exists) (2:1-2).</p><p>Some scholars stated that this Ayah - 2:2 - contains a prohibition meaning, ""Do not doubt the Qur'an."" Furthermore, some of the reciters of the Qur'an pause upon reading,</p><p>لاَ رَيْبَ</p><p>(there is no doubt) and they then continue;</p><p>فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(in which there is guidance for the Muttaqin (the pious and righteous persons)). However, it is better to pause at,</p><p>لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p>(in which there is no doubt) because in this case,</p><p>هُدًى</p><p>(guidance) becomes an attribute of the Qur'an and carries a better meaning than,</p><p>فِيهِ هُدًى</p><p>(in which there is guidance).</p><h2>Guidance is granted to Those Who have Taqwa</h2><p>Hidayah - correct guidance - is only granted to those who have Taqwa - fear of Allah. Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُوْلَـئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)) (41:44), and,</p><p>وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا</p><p>(And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zalimin (wrongdoers) in nothing but loss) (17:82).</p><p>This is a sample of the numerous Ayat indicating that the believers, in particular, benefit from the Qur'an. That is because the Qur'an is itself a form of guidance, but the guidance in it is only granted to the righteous, just as Allah said,</p><p>يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُمْ مَّوْعِظَةٌ مَّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَآءٌ لِّمَا فِى الصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i. e. the Qur'an, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that (disease of ignorance, doubt, hypocrisy and differences) which is in your breasts, ـ a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers) (10:57).</p><p>Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Mas`ud and other Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(guidance for the Muttaqin (the pious and righteous persons), means, a light for those who have Taqwa.</p><h2>The Meaning of Al-Muttaqin</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas said about,</p><p>هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(guidance for the Muttaqin) that it means, ""They are the believers who avoid Shirk with Allah and who work in His obedience."" Ibn `Abbas also said that Al-Muttaqin means, ""Those who fear Allah's punishment, which would result if they abandoned the true guidance that they recognize and know. They also hope in Allah's mercy by believing in what He revealed."" Further, Qatadah said that,</p><p>لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Al-Muttaqin), are those whom Allah has described in His statement;</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ</p><p>(Who believe in the Ghayb and perform the Salah) (2:3), and the following Ayat. Ibn Jarir stated that the Ayah (2:2) includes all of these meanings that the scholars have mentioned, and this is the correct view. Also, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah narrated that `Atiyah As-Sa`di said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا يَبْلُغُ الْعَبْدُ أَنْ يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ حَتَّى يَدَعَ مَالَا بَأْسَ بِهِ حَذَرًا مِمَّا بِهِ بَأْس»</p><p>(The servant will not acquire the status of the Muttaqin until he abandons what is harmless out of fear of falling into that which is harmful.) At-Tirmidhi then said ""Hasan Gharib.""</p><h2>There are Two Types of Hidayah (Guidance)</h2><p>Huda here means the faith that resides in the heart, and only Allah is able to create it in the heart of the servants. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّكَ لاَ تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ</p><p>(Verily, you (O Muhammad ) guide not whom you like) (28:56),</p><p>لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ</p><p>(Not upon you (Muhammad ) is their guidance) (2:272),</p><p>مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ</p><p>(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him) (7:186), and,</p><p>مَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</p><p>(He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead him (to the right path)) (18:17).</p><p>Huda also means to explain the truth, give direction and lead to it. Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p>وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, you (O Muhammad ) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the straight path (i.e. Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism)) (42: 52),</p><p>إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ</p><p>(You are only a warner, and to every people there is a guide) (13:7), and,</p><p>وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَٰـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</p><p>(And as for Thamud, We showed and made clear to them the path of truth (Islamic Monotheism) through Our Messenger (i.e. showed them the way of success), but they preferred blindness to guidance) (41:17).</p><p>testifying to this meaning.</p><p>Also, Allah said,</p><p>وَهَدَيْنَٰـهُ النَّجْدَينِ</p><p>(And shown him the two ways (good and evil).) (90:10)</p><p>This is the view of the scholars who said that the two ways refer to the paths of righteousness and evil, which is also the correct explanation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Meaning of Taqwa</h2><p>The root meaning of Taqwa is to avoid what one dislikes. It was reported that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Ubayy bin Ka`b about Taqwa. Ubayy said, ""Have you ever walked on a path that has thorns on it"" `Umar said, ""Yes."" Ubayy said, ""What did you do then"" He said, ""I rolled up my sleeves and struggled."" Ubayy said, ""That is Taqwa.""</p>"
10,"<h2>The Meaning of Iman</h2><p>Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Al-`Ala' bin Al-Musayyib bin Rafi` narrated from Abu Ishaq that Abu Al-Ahwas said that `Abdullah said, ""Iman is to trust."". `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(who have faith) means they trust. Also, Ma`mar said that Az-Zuhri said, ""Iman is the deeds."" In addition, Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that, `They have faith', means, they fear (Allah).</p><p>Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) commented, ""The prefered view is that they be described as having faith in the Unseen by the tongue, deed and creed. In this case, fear of Allah is included in the general meaning of Iman, which necessitates following deeds of the tongue by implementation. Hence, Iman is a general term that includes affirming and believing in Allah, His Books and His Messengers, and realizing this affirmation through adhering to the implications of what the tongue utters and affirms.""</p><p>Linguistically, in the absolute sense, Iman merely means trust, and it is used to mean that sometimes in the Qur'an, for instance, Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(He trusts (yu'minu) in Allah, and trusts (yu'minu) in the believers.) (9: 61)</p><p>Prophet Yusuf's brothers said to their father,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَّنَا وَلَوْ كُنَّا صَٰـدِقِينَ</p><p>(But you will never believe us even when we speak the truth) (12:17).</p><p>Further, the word Iman is sometimes mentioned along with deeds, such as Allah said,</p><p>إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّٰـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(Save those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous deeds) (95:6).</p><p>However, when Iman is used in an unrestricted manner, it includes beliefs, deeds, and statements of the tongue.We should state here that Iman increases and decreases.</p><p>There are many narrations and Hadiths on this subject, and we discussed them in the beginning of our explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari, all favors are from Allah. Some scholars explained that Iman means Khashyah (fear of Allah). For instance, Allah said;</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen (i.e. they do not see Him, nor His punishment in the Hereafter)) (67:12), and,</p><p>مَّنْ خَشِىَ الرَّحْمَٰـنَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَجَآءَ بِقَلْبٍ مُّنِيبٍ</p><p>(Who feared the Most Gracious (Allah) in the Ghayb (unseen) and brought a heart turned in repentance (to Him and absolutely free from every kind of polytheism)) (50: 33).</p><p>Fear is the core of Iman and knowledge, just as Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</p><p>(It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah) (35:28).</p><h2>The Meaning of Al-Ghayb</h2><p>As for the meaning of Ghayb here, the Salaf have different explanations of it, all of which are correct, indicating the same general meaning. For instance, Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi quoted Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, reporting from Abu Al-`Aliyah about Allah's statement, i</p><p>يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>((Those who) have faith in the Ghayb), ""They believe in Allah, His angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, His Paradise, Fire and in the meeting with Him. They also believe in life after death and in Resurrection. All of this is the Ghayb."" Qatadah bin Di`amah said similarly.</p><p>Sa`id bin Mansur reported from `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid who said, ""We were sitting with `Abdullah bin Mas`ud when we mentioned the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ and their deeds being superior to our deeds. `Abdullah said, `The matter of Muhammad was clear for those who saw him. By He other than Whom there is no God, no person will ever acquire a better type of faith than believing in Al-Ghayb.' He then recited,</p><p>الم - ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. This is the Book, wherein there is no doubt, a guidance for the Muttaqin. Those who believe in the Ghayb), until,</p><p>الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(the successful). "" Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduwyah and Al-Hakim, in his Mustadrak, recorded this Hadith. Al-Hakim commented that this Hadith is authentic and that the Two Shaykhs - Al-Bukhari and Muslim - did not collect it, although it meets their criteria.</p><p>Ahmad recorded a Hadith with similar meaning from Ibn Muhayriz who said: I said to Abu Jumu`ah, ""Narrate a Hadith for us that you heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ."" He said, ""Yes. I will narrate a good Hadith for you. Once we had lunch with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . Abu `Ubaydah, who was with us, said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! Are people better than us We embraced Islam with you and performed Jihad with you.' He said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ قَوْمٌ مِنْ بَعْدِكُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِي وَلَمْ يَرَوْنِي»</p><p>(Yes, those who will come after you, who will believe in me although they did not see me.)""</p><p>This Hadith has another route collected by Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah in his Tafsir, from Salih bin Jubayr who said: `Abu Jumu`ah Al-Ansari, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , came to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) to perform the prayer. Raja' bin Haywah was with us, so when Abu Jumu`ah finished, we went out to greet him. When he was about to leave, he said, ""You have a gift and a right. I will narrate a Hadith for you that I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . "" We said, ""Do so, and may Allah grant you mercy."" He said, ""We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , ten people including Mu`adh bin Jabal. We said, ""O Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! Are there people who will acquire greater rewards than us We believed in Allah and followed you.' He said,</p><p>«مَا يَمْنَعُكُمْ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَرَسُولُ اللهِ بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِالْوَحْيِ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، بَلْ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَكُمْ يَأْتِيهِمْ كِتَابٌ مِنْ بَيْنِ لَوْحَيْنِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَيَعْمَلُونَ بِمَا فِيهِ، أُولٰئِكَ أَعْظَمُ مِنْكُمْ أَجْرًا مَرَّتَيْن»</p><p>(What prevents you from doing so, while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is among you, bringing you the revelation from heaven There are people who will come after you and who will be given a book between two covers (the Qur'an), and they will believe in it and implement its commands. They have a greater reward than you, even twice as much.)""</p><p>وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(And perform Salah, and spend out of what we have provided for them)</p><h2>Meaning of Iqamat As-Salah</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ</p><p>(And perform the Salah), means, ""Perform the prayer with all of the obligations that accompany it."" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Iqamat As-Salah means to complete the bowings, prostrations, recitation, humbleness and attendance for the prayer."" Qatadah said, ""Iqamat As-Salah means to preserve punctuality, and the ablution, bowings, and prostrations of the prayer."" Muqatil bin Hayyan said Iqamat As-Salah means ""To preserve punctuality for it, as well as completing ones purity for it, and completing the bowings, prostrations, recitation of the Qur'an, Tashahhud and blessings for the Prophet ﷺ. This is Iqamat As-Salah.""</p><h2>The Meaning of ""Spending"" in this Ayah</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(And spend out of what We have provided for them) means, ""The Zakah due on their wealth."" As-Suddi said that Abu Malik and Abu Salih narrated from Ibn `Abbas, as well as Murrah from Ibn Mas`ud and other Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , that,</p><p>وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(And spend out of what We have provided for them) means, ""A man's spending on his family. This was before the obligation of Zakah was revealed."" Juwaybir narrated from Ad-Dahhak, ""General spending (in charity) was a means of drawing nearer to Allah, according to one's discretion and capability. Until the obligation of charity was revealed in the seven Ayat of Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9), were revealed. These abrogated the previous case.""</p><p>In many instances, Allah mentioned prayer and spending wealth together. Prayer is a right of Allah as well as a form of worshipping Him. It includes singling Him out for one's devotion, praising Him, glorifying Him, supplicating to Him, invoking Him, and it displays one's dependence upon Him. Spending is form of kindness towards creatures by giving them what will benefit them, and those people most deserving of this charity are the relatives, the wife, the servants and then the rest of the people. So all types of required charity and required spending are included in Allah's saying,</p><p>وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(And spend out of what we have provided for them). The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«بُنِيَ الْإِسْلَامُ عَلَى خَمْسٍ: شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللهِ، وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَاةِ، وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ، وَصَوْمِ رَمَضَانَ، وَحَجِّ الْبَيْت»</p><p>(Islam is built upon five (pillars): Testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , establishing the prayer, giving Zakah, fasting Ramadan and Hajj to the House.)</p><p>There are many other Hadiths on this subject.</p><h2>The Meaning of Salah</h2><p>In the Arabic language, the basic meaing of Salah is supplication. In religious terminology, Salah is used to refer to the acts of bowing and prostration, the remaining specified acts associated with it, specificed at certain times, with those known conditions, and the characteristics, and requirements that are well-known about it.</p>"
11,"<p>Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ</p><p>(And who have faith in what is revealed to you and in what was revealed before you.) means, ""They believe in what Allah sent you with, and in what the previous Messengers were sent with, they do not distinguish between (believing) them, nor do they reject what they brought from their Lord.""</p><p>وَبِالأْخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ</p><p>(And in the Hereafter they are certain) that is the resurrection, the standing (on the Day of Resurrection), Paradise, the Fire, the reckoning and the the Scale that weighs the deeds (the Mizan). The Hereafter is so named because it comes after this earthly life.</p><h2>Attributes of the Believers</h2><p>The people described here (2:4) are those whom Allah described in the preceding Ayah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(Those who have faith in the Ghayb and perform Salah, and spend out of what we have provided for them.)</p><p>Mujahid once stated, ""Four Ayat at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah describe the believers, two describe the disbelievers, and thirteen describe the hypocrites."" The four Ayat mentioned in this statement are general and include every believer, whether an Arab, non-Arab, or a person of a previous Scripture, whether they are Jinns or humans. All of these attributes complement each other and require the existence of the other attributes. For instance, it is not possible that one believes in the Unseen, performs the prayer and gives Zakah without believing in what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the previous Messengers were sent with. The same with certainty in the Hereafter, this is not correct without that, for Allah has commanded the believers,</p><p>يَٰـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ءَامِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَٰـبِ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَٰـبِ الَّذِى أَنَزلَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(O you who believe!

Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ""We make no distinction between any of His Messengers"") (2: 285), and,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلَمْ يُفَرِّقُواْ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers)) (4:152),</p><p>This is a sample of the Ayat that indicate that the true believers all believe in Allah, His Messengers and His Books.</p><p>The faithful among the People of the Book, have a special significance here, since they believe in their Books and in all of the details related to that, so when such people embrace Islam and sincerely believe in the details of the religion, then they will get two rewards. As for the others, they can only believe in the previous religious teachings in a general way. For instance, the Prophet ﷺ stated,</p><p>«إِذَا حَدَثَكُمْ أَهْلُ الْكِتَابِ فَلَا تُكَذِّبُوهُمْ وَلَا تُصَدِقُوهُمْ وَلكِنْ قُولُوا: آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُم»</p><p>(When the People of the Book narrate to you, neither reject nor affirm what they say. Rather, say, 'We believe in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to you.')</p><p>However, the faith that many Arabs have in the religion of Islam as it was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ might be more complete, encompassing and firmer than the faith of the People of the Book who embraced Islam. Therefore, if the believers in Islam among the People of the Book gain two rewards, other Muslims who have firmer Islamic faith might gain an equal reward that compares to the two the People of the Book gain (upon embracing Islam). And Allah knows best.</p>"

14,"<h2>Meaning of Khatama</h2><p>As-Suddi said that,</p><p>خَتَمَ اللَّهُ</p><p>(Khatama Allah) means, ""Allah has sealed."" Qatadah said that this Ayah means, ""Shaytan controlled them when they obeyed him. Therefore, Allah sealed their hearts, hearing and sight, and they could neither see the guidance nor hear, comprehend or understand."" Ibn Jurayj said that Mujahid said,</p><p>خَتَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ</p><p>(Allah has set a seal on their hearts), ""A stamp. It occurs when sin resides in the heart and surrounds it from all sides, and this submersion of the heart in sin constitutes a stamp, meaning a seal."" Ibn Jurayj also said that the seal is placed on the heart and the hearing. In addition, Ibn Jurayj said, that `Abdullah bin Kathir narrated that Mujahid said, ""The stain is not as bad as the stamp, the stamp is not as bad as the lock which is the worst type."" Al-A`mash said, ""Mujahid demonstrated with his hand while saying, `They used to say that the heart is just like this - meaning the open palm. When the servant commits a sin, a part of the heart will be rolled up - and he rolled up his index finger. When the servant commits another sin, a part of the heart will be rolled up' - and he rolled up another finger, until he rolled up all of his fingers. Then he said, `Then, the heart will be sealed.' Mujahid also said that this is the description of the Ran (refer to 83:14).""</p><p>Al-Qurtubi said, ""The Ummah has agreed that Allah has described Himself with sealing and closing the hearts of the disbelievers, as a punishment for their disbelief. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>بَلْ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ</p><p>(Nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief) (4:155).""</p><p>He then mentioned the Hadith about changing the hearts, (in which the Prophet ﷺ supplicated),</p><p>«يَا مُقَلِبَ الْقُلُوبِ ثَبِّتْ قُلُوبَنَا عَلى دِينِك»</p><p>(O You Who changes the hearts, make our hearts firm on Your religion.)</p><p>He also mentioned the Hadith by Hudhayfah recorded in the Sahih, in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«تُعْرَضُ الْفِتَنُ عَلَى الْقُلُوبِ كَالْحَصِيرِ عُودًا عُودًا، فَأَيُّ قَلْبٍ أُشْرِبَهَا نُكِتَ فِيه نُكْتَةٌ سَوْدَاءُ وَأَيُّ قَلْبٍ أَنْكَرَهَا نُكِتَ فِيهِ نُكْتَةٌ بَيْضَاءُ حَتى تَصِيرَ عَلَى قَلْبَيْنِ: عَلى أَبْيَضَ مِثْلِ الصَّفَا، فَلَا تَضُرُّهُ فِتْنَةٌ مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ وَالْآخَرُ أَسْوَدُ مُرْبَادًّا كَالْكُوزِ مُجَخِّيًا لَا يَعْرِفُ مَعْرُوفًا وَلَا يُنْكِرُ مُنْكَرًا»</p><p>(The Fitan (trials, tests) are offered to the hearts, just as the straws that are sewn into a woven mat, one after another.

The hearts will therefore become two categories: white, just like the barren rock; no Fitnah shall ever harm this category as long as the heavens and earth still exist. Another category is black, just as the cup that is turned upside down, for this heart does not recognize righteousness or renounce evil. )</p><p>Ibn Jarir said, ""The truth regarding this subject is what the authentic Hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stated.

The two last Ayat (2:6-7) describe the disbelievers. Afterwards, Allah begins to describe the hypocrites who show belief and hide disbelief. Since the matter of the hypocrites is vague and many people do not realize their true reality, Allah mentioned their description in detail. Each of the characteristics that Allah used to described them with is a type of hypocrisy itself. Allah revealed Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9) and Surat Al-Munafiqun (chapter 63) about the hypocrites. He also mentioned the hypocrites in Surat An-Nur (24) and other Surahs, so that their description would be known and their ways and errors could be avoided. Allah said,</p>"
15,"<h2>Meaning of Nifaq</h2><p>Nifaq means to show conformity - or agreement - and to conceal evil. Nifaq has several types: Nifaq in the creed that causes its people to reside in Hell for eternity, and Nifaq in deed, which is one of the major sins, as we will explain soon, Allah willing. Ibn Jurayj said of the hypocrite that, ""His actual deeds are different from what he publicizes, what he conceals is different from what he utters, his entrance and presence are not the same as his exit and absence.""</p><h2>The Beginning of Hypocrisy</h2><p>The revelations about the characteristics of the hypocrites were revealed in Al-Madinah, this is because there were no hypocrites in Makkah. Rather the opposite was the situation in Makkah, since some people were forced to pretend that they were disbelievers, while their hearts concealed their faith. Afterwards, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Al-Madinah, where the Ansar from the tribes of Aws and Khazraj resided. They used to worship idols during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance, just as the rest of the Arab idolators. Three Jewish tribes resided in Al-Madinah, Banu Qaynuqa`-allies of Al-Khazraj, Banu An-Nadir and Banu Qurayzah-allies of the Aws. Many members of the Aws and Khazraj tribes embraced Islam. However, only a few Jews embraced Islam, such as `Abdullah bin Salam. During the early stage in Al-Madinah, there weren't any hypocrites because the Muslims were not strong enough to be feared yet. On the contrary, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ conducted peace treaties with the Jews and several other Arab tribes around Al-Madinah. Soon after, the battle of Badr occurred and Allah gave victory to Islam and its people. `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul was a leader in Al-Madinah. He was Al-Khazraj's chief, and during the period of Jahiliyyah he was the master of both tribes - Aws and Khazraj. They were about to appoint him their king when the Message reached Al-Madinah, and many in Al-Madinah embraced Islam. Ibn Salul's heart was filled with hatred against Islam and its people. When the battle of Badr took place, he said, ""Allah's religion has become apparent."" So he pretended to be Muslim, along with many of those who were just like him, as well as many among the People of the Book. It was then that hypocrisy began in Al-Madinah and among the surrounding nomad tribes. As for the Emigrants, none of them were hypocrites, since they emigrated willingly (seeking the pleasure of Allah). Rather, when a Muslim would emigrate from Makkah, he would be forced to abandon all of his wealth, offspring and land; he would do so seeking Allah's reward in the Hereafter.</p><h2>The Tafsir of Ayah 2:8</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الأْخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And of mankind, there are some who say: ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day"" while in fact they do not believe) ""This refers to the hypocrites among the Aws and Khazraj and those who behaved as they did.""</p><p>This is how Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi explained this Ayah. Allah revealed the characteristics of the hypocrites, so that the believers would not be deceived by their outer appearance, thus saving the believers from a great evil. Otherwise, the believers might think that the hypocrites were believers, when in reality they are disbelievers. To consider the sinners as righteous people is extremely dangerous, Allah said,</p><p>وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الأْخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And of mankind, there are some who say: ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day"" while in fact they do not believe) meaning, they utter these false statements only with their tongues, just as Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَكَ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ قَالُواْ نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ</p><p>(When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad ), they say: ""We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."" Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger) (63:1).</p><p>This Ayah means that the hypocrites utter these statements only when they meet you, not because they actually believe what they are saying. The hypocrites emphasize their belief in Allah and the Last Day with their words, when that is not the case in reality. Therefore, Allah stated that the hypocrites lie in their testimony of creed, when He said,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ لَكَـذِبُونَ</p><p>(And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.) (63:1), and,</p><p>وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(while in fact they believe not)</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>يُخَـدِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا</p><p>(They try to deceive Allah and those who believe). The hypocrites show belief outwardly while concealing disbelief. They think that by doing this, they will mislead Allah, or that the statements they utter will help them with Allah, and this is an indication of their total ignorance. They think that such behavior will deceive Allah, just as it might deceive some of the believers. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you. And they think that they have something (to stand upon). Verily, they are liars!) (58:18). aHence, Allah refuted their way by saying,</p><p>وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إلاَّ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(While they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!) Allah stated that the hypocrites only deceive themselves by this behavior, although they are unaware of this fact. Allah also said,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ يُخَـدِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them) (4:142).</p><p>Also, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibn Jurayj commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ يُخَـدِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them), ""The hypocrites pronounce, `There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah' seeking to ensure the sanctity of their blood and money, all the while concealing disbelief.""Sa`id said that Qatadah said,</p><p>وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الأْخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ - يُخَـدِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إلاَّ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(And of mankind, there are some who say: ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day"" while in fact they believe not. They try to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!) ""This is the description of a hypocrite. He is devious, he says the truth with his tongue and defies it with his heart and deeds. He wakes up in a condition other than the one he goes to sleep in, and goes to sleep in a different condition than the one he wakes up in. He changes his mind just like a ship that moves about whenever a wind blows.""</p>"

17,"<h2>The Meaning of `Disease' in this Ayah</h2><p>As-Suddi narrated from Abu Malik and (also) from Abu Salih, from Ibn `Abbas, and (also) Murrah Al-Hamdani from Ibn Mas`ud and other Companions that this Ayah,</p><p>فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ</p><p>(In their hearts is a disease) means, `doubt', and,</p><p>فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا</p><p>(And Allah has increased their disease) also means `doubt'. Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah also said similarly. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented on,</p><p>فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ</p><p>(In their hearts is a disease), ""A disease in the religion, not a physical disease. They are the hypocrites and the disease is the doubt that they brought to Islam.</p><p>فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا</p><p>(And Allah has increased their disease) meaning, increased them in shameful behavior."" He also recited,</p><p>فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَوَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</p><p>(As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add disgrace to their disgrace.) (9:124-125) and commented, ""Evil to their evil and deviation to their deviation."" This statement by `Abdur-Rahman is true, and it constitutes a punishment that is compatible to the sin, just as the earlier scholars stated. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَءَاتَـهُمْ تَقُوَاهُمْ</p><p>(While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and grants them their piety) (47:17).</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْذِبُونَ</p><p>(Because they used to tell lies). The hypocrites have two characteristics, they lie and they deny the Unseen.</p><p>The scholars who stated that the Prophet ﷺ knew the hypocrites of his time have only the Hadith of Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman as evidence. In it the Prophet ﷺ gave him the names of fourteen hypocrites during the battle of Tabuk. These hypocrites plotted to assassinate the Prophet ﷺ during the night on a hill in that area. They planned to excite the Prophet's ﷺ camel, so that she would throw him down the hill. Allah informed the Prophet ﷺ about their plot, and the Prophet ﷺ told Hudhayfah their names.</p><p>As for the other hypocrites, Allah said about them,</p><p>وَمِمَّنْ حَوْلَكُم مِّنَ الاٌّعْرَابِ مُنَـفِقُونَ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ الْمَدِينَةِ مَرَدُواْ عَلَى النَّفَاقِ لاَ تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ</p><p>(And among the bedouins around you, some are hypocrites, and so are some among the people of Al-Madinah who persist in hypocrisy; you (O Muhammad ) know them not, We know them) (9:101), and,</p><p>لَّئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ وَالْمُرْجِفُونَ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَآ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً - مَّلْعُونِينَ أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُواْ أُخِذُواْ وَقُتِّلُواْ تَقْتِيلاً</p><p>(If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah do not cease, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while. Accursed, they shall be seized wherever found, and killed with a (terrible) slaughter) (33:60-61).</p><p>These Ayat prove that the Prophet ﷺ was not informed about each and everyone among the hypocrites of his time. Rather, the Prophet ﷺ was only informed about their characteristics, and he used to assume that some people possessed these characteristics. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لأَرَيْنَـكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p>(Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks; but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) (47:30).</p><p>The most notorious hypocrite at that time was `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul; Zayd bin Arqam - the Companion - gave truthful testimony to that effect. In addition, `Umar bin Al-Khattab once mentioned the matter of Ibn Salul to the Prophet ﷺ, who said,</p><p>«إِنِّي أَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَتَحَدَّثَ الْعَرَبُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَه»</p><p>(I would not like the Arabs to say to each other that Muhammad is killing his Companions.)</p><p>Yet, when Ibn Salul died, the Prophet ﷺ performed the funeral prayer for him and attended his funeral just as he used to do with other Muslims. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنِّي خُيِّرْتُ فَاخْتَرْت»</p><p>(I was given the choice (to pray for him or not), so I chose.)</p><p>In another narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْ أَعْلَمُ أَنِّي لَوْ زِدْتُ عَلَى السَّبْعِينَ يُغْفَرُ لَهُ لَزِدْت»</p><p>(If I knew that by asking (Allah to forgive Ibn Salul) more than seventy times that He would forgive him, then I would do that.)</p>"
294,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madina</h2><p>Surah Al `Imran was revealed in Al-Madinah, as evident by the fact that the first eighty-three Ayat in it relate to the delegation from Najran that arrived in Al-Madinah on the ninth year of Hijrah (632 CE). We will elaborate on this subject when we explain the Ayah about the Mubahalah 3:61 in this Surah, Allah willing. We should also state that we mentioned the virtues of Surah Al `Imran along with the virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah in the beginning of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p><p>We mentioned the Hadith in the Tafsir of Ayat Al-Kursi 2:255 that mentions that Allah's Greatest Name is contained in these two Ayat,</p><p>اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</p><p>(Allah!

Verily, Allah revealed the Qur'an with His knowledge, and the angels testify to this fact, Allah is sufficient as a Witness. Allah's statement,</p><p>مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</p><p>(Confirming what came before it) means, from the previous divinely revealed Books, sent to the servants and Prophets of Allah. These Books testify to the truth of the Qur'an, and the Qur'an also testifies to the truth these Books contained, including the news and glad tidings of Muhammad's ﷺ prophethood and the revelation of the Glorious Qur'an.</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنزَلَ التَّوْرَاةَ</p><p>(And He sent down the Tawrah) to Musa (Musa) son of `Imran,</p><p>وَالإِنجِيلَ</p><p>(And the Injil), to `Isa, son of Mary,</p><p>مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(Aforetime) meaning, before the Qur'an was revealed,</p><p>هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ</p><p>(As a guidance to mankind) in their time.</p><p>وَأَنزَلَ الْفُرْقَانَ</p><p>(And He sent down the criterion) which is the distinction between misguidance, falsehood and deviation on one hand, and guidance, truth and piety on the other hand.

This Ayah refers to the fact that `Isa, son of Mary, is a created servant, just as Allah created the rest of mankind. Allah created `Isa in the womb (of his mother) and shaped him as He willed. Therefore, how could `Isa be divine, as the Christians, may Allah's curses descend on them, claim `Isa was created in the womb and his creation changed from stage to stage, just as Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَـتِكُـمْ خَلْقاً مِّن بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتٍ ثَلَـثٍ</div><p>(He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.) 39:6.</p>"

300,"<h2>The Mutashabihat and Muhkamat Ayat</h2><p>Allah states that in the Qur'an, there are Ayat that are Muhkamat, entirely clear and plain, and these are the foundations of the Book which are plain for everyone. And there are Ayat in the Qur'an that are Mutashabihat not entirely clear for many, or some people. So those who refer to the Muhkam Ayat to understand the Mutashabih Ayat, will have acquired the correct guidance, and vice versa. This is why Allah said,</p><p>هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(They are the foundations of the Book), meaning, they are the basis of the Qur'an, and should be referred to for clarification, when warranted,</p><p>وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ</p><p>(And others not entirely clear) as they have several meanings, some that agree with the Muhkam and some that carry other literal indications, although these meaning might not be desired.</p><p>The Muhkamat are the Ayat that explain the abrogating rulings, the allowed, prohibited, laws, limits, obligations and rulings that should be believed in and implemented. As for the Mutashabihat Ayat, they include the abrogated Ayat, parables, oaths, and what should be believed in, but not implemented.</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar commented on,</p><p>مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ</p><p>(In it are verses that are entirely clear) as ""Containing proof of the Lord, immunity for the servants and a refutation of opponents and of falsehood. They cannot be changed or altered from what they were meant for."" He also said, ""As for the unclear Ayat, they can (but must not) be altered and changed, and this is a test from Allah to the servants, just as He tested them with the allowed and prohibited things. So these Ayat must not be altered to imply a false meaning or be distorted from the truth.""</p><p>Therefore, Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ</p><p>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation) meaning, those who are misguided and deviate from truth to falsehood,</p><p>فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـبَهَ مِنْهُ</p><p>(they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof) meaning, they refer to the Mutashabih, because they are able to alter its meanings to conform with their false interpretation since the wordings of the Mutashabihat encompass such a wide area of meanings. As for the Muhkam Ayat, they cannot be altered because they are clear and, thus, constitute unequivocal proof against the misguided people. This is why Allah said,</p><p>ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ</p><p>(seeking Al-Fitnah) meaning, they seek to misguide their following by pretending to prove their innovation by relying on the Qur'an -- the Mutashabih of it -- but, this is proof against and not for them. For instance, Christians might claim that `Isa is divine because the Qur'an states that he is Ruhullah and His Word, which He gave to Mary, all the while ignoring Allah's statements,</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He `Isa was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him.) 43:59, and,</p><p>إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ""Be!"" and he was.) 3:59.</p><p>There are other Ayat that clearly assert that `Isa is but one of Allah's creatures and that he is the servant and Messenger of Allah ﷺ, among other Messengers.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>(And seeking for its Ta'wil,) to alter them as they desire. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear,), until,</p><p>أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(Men of understanding) and he said,</p><p>«فَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِين يُجَادِلُونَ فِيهِ، فَهُمُ الَّذِينَ عَنَى اللهُ، فَاحْذَرُوهُم»</p><p>(When you see those who argue in it (using the Mutashabihat), then they are those whom Allah meant. Therefore, beware of them.)""</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith in the Tafsir of this Ayah 3:7, as did Muslim in the book of Qadar (the Divine Will) in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud in the Sunnah section of his Sunan, from `A'ishah; ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear,) until,</p><p>وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)</p><p>He then said,</p><p>«فَإِذَا رَأَيْتِ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ؛ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ، فَاحْذَرُوهُم»</p><p>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear of the Qur'an, then they are those whom Allah described, so beware of them.)""</p><p>This is the wording recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p><h2>Only Allah Knows the True Ta'wil (Interpretation) of the Mutashabihat</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(But none knows its Ta'wil except Allah.)</p><p>Similarly, as preceded in what has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""Tafsir is of four types: Tafsir that the Arabs know in their language; Tafsir that no one is excused of being ignorant of; Tafsir that the scholars know; and Tafsir that only Allah knows."" Scholars of Qur'an recitation have different opinions about pausing at Allah's Name in this Ayah. This stop was reported from `A'ishah, `Urwah, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' and Abu Nahik.</p><p>Some pause after reciting,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) saying that the Qur'an does not address the people with what they cannot understand. Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said, ""I am among those who are firmly grounded in its Ta'wil interpretation."" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ supplicated for the benefit of Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ فَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينِ وَعَلِّمْهُ التَّأْوِيل»</p><p>(O Allah! Bestow on him knowledge in the religion and teach him the Ta'wil (interpretation).)</p><p>Ta'wil has two meanings in the Qur'an, the true reality of things, and what they will turn out to be. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>وَقَالَ يأَبَتِ هَـذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَـى مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(And he said: ""O my father! This is the Ta'wil of my dream aforetime!"".) 12:100, and,</p><p>هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ تَأْوِيلَهُ يَوْمَ يَأْتِى تَأْوِيلُهُ</p><p>(Await they just for it's Ta'wil On the Day (Day of Resurrection) it's Ta'wil is finally fulfillled.)(7:53) refers to the true reality of Resurrection that they were told about. If this is the meaning desired in the Ayah above 3:7, then pausing after reciting Allah's Name is warranted, because only Allah knows the true reality of things. In this case, Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) is connected to His statement,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(say: ""We believe in it"") If the word Ta'wil means the second meaning, that is, explaining and describing, such as what Allah said,</p><p>نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>((They said): ""Inform us of the Ta'wil of this"") meaning its explanation, then pausing after reciting,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) is warranted. This is because the scholars have general knowledge in, and understand what they were addressed with, even though they do not have knowledge of the true reality of things. Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(say: ""We believe in it"") describes the conduct of the scholars. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَجَآءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفّاً صَفّاً</p><p>(And your Lord comes, and the angels, in rows.) 89:22 means, your Lord will come, and the angels will come in rows.</p><p>Allah's statement that the knowledgeable people proclaim,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(We believe in it) means, they believe in the Mutashabih.</p><p>كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا</p><p>(all of it is from our Lord) meaning, both the Muhkam and the Mutashabih are true and authentic, and each one of them testifies to the truth of the other. This is because they both are from Allah and nothing that comes from Allah is ever met by contradiction or discrepancy. Allah said,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ اخْتِلَـفاً كَثِيراً</p><p>(Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.) 4:82.</p><p>Allah said in his Ayah 3:7,</p><p>وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding. ) meaning, those who have good minds and sound comprehension, understand, contemplate and comprehend the meaning in the correct manner. Further, Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded in his Tafsir that Nafi` bin Yazid said, ""Those firmly grounded in knowledge are those who are modest for Allah's sake, humbly seek His pleasure, and do not exaggerate regarding those above them, or belittle those below them.""</p><p>Allah said that they supplicate to their Lord,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا</p><p>(Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us.) meaning, ""Do not deviate our hearts from the guidance after You allowed them to acquire it. Do not make us like those who have wickedness in their hearts, those who follow the Mutashabih in the Qur'an. Rather, make us remain firmly on Your straight path and true religion.""</p><p>وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ</p><p>(And grant us from Ladunka) meaning, from You,</p><p>رَحْمَةً</p><p>(Mercy) with which You make our hearts firm, and increase in our Faith and certainty,</p><p>إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(Truly, You are the Bestower)</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded that Umm Salamah said that the Prophet used to supplicate,</p><p>«يَا مُقَلِّبَ الْقُلُوبِ ثَبِّتْ قَلْبِي عَلَى دِينِك»</p><p>(O You Who changes the hearts, make my heart firm on Your religion.)</p><p>He then recited,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(""Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower."") The Ayah continues,</p><p>رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ النَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p>(""Our Lord! Verily, it is You Who will gather mankind together on the Day about which there is no doubt"") meaning, they say in their supplication: O our Lord! You will gather Your creation on the Day of Return, judge between them and decide over what they disputed about. Thereafter, You will reward or punish each according to the deeds they did in this life.</p>"

Verily, the most curved portion of the rib is its upper part, so, if you should try to straighten it, you will break it, but if you leave it as it is, it will remain crooked.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالاً كَثِيراً وَنِسَآءً</p><p>(And from them both He created many men and women;) means, Allah created from Adam and Hawwa' many men and women and distributed them throughout the world in various shapes, characteristics, colors and languages. In the end, their gathering and return will be to Allah. Allah then said,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ الَّذِى تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالاٌّرْحَامَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa of Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and revere the wombs), protect yourself from Allah by your acts of obedience to Him. Allah's statement,</p><p>الَّذِى تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ</p><p>(through Whom you demand your mutual (rights)), is in reference to when some people say, ""I ask you by Allah, and then by the relation of the Rahim (the womb, i.e. my relationship to you)"", according to Ibrahim, Mujahid and Al-Hasan. Ad-Dahhak said; ""Fear Allah Whom you invoke when you conduct transactions and contracts."" ""And revere the womb by not cutting the relations of the womb, but keep and honor them, as Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi`, and others have stated. Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيباً</p><p>(Surely, Allah is always watching over you.) means, He watches all your deeds and sees your every circumstance. In another Ayah, Allah said;</p><p>وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p><p>(And Allah is Witness over all things.) 58:6. An authentic Hadith states,</p><p>«اعْبُدِاللهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ،فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك»</p><p>(Worship Allah as if you see Him, for even though you cannot see Him, He sees you.) This part of the Ayah encourages having a sense of certainty that Allah is always watching, in a complete and perfect manner. Allah mentioned that He has created mankind from a single father and a single mother, so that they feel compassion for each other and are kind to the weaker among them. In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali said that a delegation from Mudar came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he saw their state, wearing striped woolen clothes due to poverty. After the Zuhr prayer, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and gave a speech in which he recited,</p><p>يَٰـأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ</p><p>(O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord, Who created you from a single person,) until the end of the Ayah. He also recited,</p><p>يٰأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</p><p>(O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the tomorrow) 59:18. He also encouraged them to give charity, saying,</p><p>«تَصَدَّقَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ دِينَارِهِ، مِنْ دِرْهَمِهِ، مِنْ صَاعِ بُرِّهِ، مِنْ صَاعِ تَمْرِه»</p><p>(A man gave Sadaqah from his Dinar, from his Dirham, from his Sa` of wheat, from his Sa` of dates) until the end of the Hadith. This narration was also collected by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers from Ibn Mas`ud.</p>"
495,"<h2>Protecting the Property of the Orphans</h2><p>Allah commands that the property of the orphans be surrendered to them in full when they reach the age of adolescence, and He forbids using or confiscating any part of it. So He said;</p><p>وَلاَ تَتَبَدَّلُواْ الْخَبِيثَ بِالطَّيِّبِ</p><p>(and do not exchange (your) bad things for (their) good ones;) Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib and Az-Zuhri commented, ""Do not substitute a weak animal of yours for a fat animal (of the orphans)."" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Ad-Dahhak commented, ""Do not give something of bad quality for something of good quality."" As-Suddi said, ""One of them (caretakers of orphans) would take a fat sheep from the orphan's property and put in its place, a weak sheep of his, saying, `A sheep for a sheep.' He would also take a good Dirham and exchange it for a fake Dirham, saying, `A Dirham for a Dirham.""' Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَلَهُمْ إِلَى أَمْوَلِكُمْ</p><p>(and devour not their substance to your substance.) means, do not mix them together so that you eat up both, as Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi and Sufyan bin Hassin stated. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوباً كَبِيراً</p><p>(Surely, this is a great sin. ), a major and substantial sin, according to Ibn `Abbas. This was also reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Malik, Zayd bin Aslam and Abu Sinan. The meaning above is: adding their property to your property is a grave sin and a major mistake, so avoid it.</p><h2>The Prohibition of Marrying Female Orphans Without Giving a Dowry</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِى الْيَتَـمَى فَانكِحُواْ مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ النِّسَآءِ مَثْنَى</p><p>(And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two) Allah commands, when one of you is the caretaker of a female orphan and he fears that he might not give her a dowry that is suitable for women of her status, he should marry other women, who are plenty as Allah has not restricted him. Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, ""A man was taking care of a female orphan and he married her, although he did not desire to marry her. That girl's money was mixed with his, and he was keeping her portion from her. Afterwards, this Ayah was revealed about his case;</p><p>وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ</p><p>(If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly)"" Al-Bukhari recorded that `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said that he asked `A'ishah about the meaning of the statement of Allah,</p><p>وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِى الْيَتَـمَى</p><p>(If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls.) She said, ""O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him to marry her without giving her an adequate dowry which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable dowry; otherwise they were ordered to marry woman besides them."" `A'ishah further said, ""After that verse, the people again asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (about marriage with orphan girls), so Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِى النِّسَآءِ</p><p>(They ask your instruction concerning the women..) 4:127."" She said, ""Allah's statement in this Ayah,</p><p>وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ</p><p>(yet whom you desire to marry) 4:127 refers to the guardian who does not desire to marry an orphan girl under his supervision because she is neither wealthy nor beautiful. The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy).""</p><h2>The Permission to Marry Four Women</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>مَثْنَى وَثُلَـثَ وَرُبَاعَ</p><p>(two or three, or four), means, marry as many women as you like, other than the orphan girls, two, three or four. We should mention that Allah's statement in another Ayah,</p><p>جَاعِلِ الْمَلَـئِكَةِ رُسُلاً أُوْلِى أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَى وَثُلَـثَ وَرُبَـعَ</p><p>(Who made the angels messengers with wings, - two or three or four) 35:1, does not mean that other angels do not have more than four wings, as there are proofs that some angels do have more wings. Yet, men are prohibited from marrying more than four wives, as the Ayah decrees, since the Ayah specifies what men are allowed of wives, as Ibn `Abbas and the majority of scholars stated. If it were allowed for them to have more than four wives, the Ayah would have mentioned it. Imam Ahmad recorded that Salim said that his father said that Ghilan bin Salamah Ath-Thaqafi had ten wives when he became Muslim, and the Prophet said to him, ""Choose any four of them (and divorce the rest)."" During the reign of `Umar, Ghilan divorced his remaining wives and divided his money between his children. When `Umar heard news of this, he said to Ghilan, ""I think that the devil has conveyed to your heart the news of your imminent death, from what the devil hears during his eavesdropping. It may as well be that you will not remain alive but for a little longer. By Allah! You will take back your wives and your money, or I will take possession of this all and will order that your grave be stoned as is the case with the grave of Abu Righal (from Thamud, who was saved from their fate because he was in the Sacred Area. But, when he left it, he was tormented like they were)."" Ash-Shafi`i, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi collected this Hadith up to the Prophet's statement, ""Choose any four of them."" Only Ahmad collected the full version of this Hadith. Therefore, had it been allowed for men to marry more than four women at the same time, the Prophet would have allowed Ghilan to keep more than four of his wives since they all embraced Islam with him. When the Prophet commanded him to keep just four of them and divorce the rest, this indicated that men are not allowed to keep more than four wives at a time under any circumstances. If this is the case concerning those who already had more than four wives upon embracing Islam, then this ruling applies even more so to marrying more than four.</p><h2>Marrying Only One Wife When One Fears He Might not Do Justice to His Wives</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ فَوَحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ</p><p>(But if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or what your right hands possess.) The Ayah commands, if you fear that you will not be able to do justice between your wives by marrying more than one, then marry only one wife, or satisfy yourself with only female captives, for it is not obligatory to treat them equally, rather it is recommended. So if one does so, that is good, and if not, there is no harm on him. In another Ayah, Allah said,</p><p>وَلَن تَسْتَطِيعُواْ أَن تَعْدِلُواْ بَيْنَ النِّسَآءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ</p><p>(You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire) 4:129. Allah said,</p><p>ذلِكَ أَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ</p><p>(That is nearer to prevent you from Ta`ulu), meaning, from doing injustice. Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduwyah and Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban, in his Sahih, recorded that `A'ishah said that, the Prophet said that the Ayah,</p><p>ذلِكَ أَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ</p><p>(That is nearer to prevent you from Ta`ulu), means, from doing injustice. However, Ibn Abi Hatim said that his father said that this Hadith to the Prophet is a mistake, for it should be attributed to `A'ishah not the Prophet . Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Ibn `Abbas, `A'ishah, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Abu Malik, Abu Razin, An-Nakha`i, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan that Ta`ulu means to deviate from justice.</p><h2>Giving the Dowry is Obligatory</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported Ibn `Abbas saying, Nihlah, in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَءَاتُواْ النِّسَآءَ صَدُقَـتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً</p><p>(And give to the women (whom you marry) their Saduqat Nihlah) refers to the dowry. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Az-Zuhri that `Urwah said that `A'ishah said that `Nihlah' means `obligatory'. Muqatil, Qatadah and Ibn Jurayj said, `Nihlah' means `obligatory' Ibn Jurayj added: `specified.' Ibn Zayd said, ""In Arabic, Nihlah, refers to what is necessary. So Allah is commanding: Do not marry unless you give your wife something that is her right. No person after the Prophet is allowed to marry a woman except with the required dowry, nor by giving false promises about the dowry intended."" Therefore, the man is required to pay a dowry to his wife with a good heart, just as he gives a gift with a good heart. If the wife gives him part or all of that dowry with a good heart, her husband is allowed to take it, as it is lawful for him in this case. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَىْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً</p><p>(But if they, of their own pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm.)</p>"

498,"<h2>Holding the Property of the Unwise in Escrow</h2><p>Allah prohibited giving the unwise the freedom to do as they wish with wealth, which Allah has made as a means of support for people. This ruling sometimes applies because of being young, as young people are incapable of making wise decisions. It also applies in cases of insanity, erratic behavior and having a weak intellect or religious practice. It applies in cases of bankruptcy, when the debtors ask that the property of a bankrupt person is put in escrow, when his debts cannot be paid off with his money. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ تُؤْتُواْ السُّفَهَآءَ أَمْوَلَكُمُ</p><p>(And give not unto the unwise your property) refers to children and women. Similar was also said by Ibn Mas`ud, Al-Hakam bin `Uyaynah, Al-Hasan and Ad-Dahhak: ""Women and boys."" Sa`id bin Jubayr said that `the unwise' refers to the orphans. Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah said; ""They are women.""</p><h2>Spending on the Unwise with Fairness</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَارْزُقُوهُمْ فِيهَا وَاكْسُوهُمْ وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً</p><p>(but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented, ""Do not give your wealth, what Allah has made you responsible for and made a means of sustenance to you, to your wife or children. Rather, hold on to your money, take care of it, and be the one who spends on them for clothes, food and provision."" Mujahid said that the Ayah,</p><p>وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً</p><p>(and speak to them words of kindness and justice.) refers to kindness and keeping good relations. This honorable Ayah commands kind treatment, in deed, with family and those under one's care. One should spend on them for clothes and provisions, and be good to them, such as saying good words to them.</p><h2>Giving Back the Property of the Orphans When They Reach Adulthood</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَابْتَلُواْ الْيَتَـمَى</p><p>(And test orphans) meaning, test their intelligence, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan stated.</p><p>حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغُواْ النِّكَاحَ</p><p>(until they reach the age of marriage), the age of puberty, according to Mujahid. The age of puberty according to the majority of scholars comes when the child has a wet dream. In his Sunan, Abu Dawud recorded that `Ali said, ""I memorized these words from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ,</p><p>«لَا يُتْمَ بَعْدَ احْتِلَامٍ، وَلَا صُمَاتَ يَوْمٍ إِلَى اللَّيْل»</p><p>(There is no orphan after the age of puberty nor vowing to be silent throughout the day to the night.) In another Hadith, `A'ishah and other Companions said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُفِعَ الْقَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلَاثَةٍ، عَنِ الصَّبِيِّ حَتَّى يَحْتَلِمَ، وَعَنِ النَّائِمِ حَتَّى يَسْتَيْقِظَ، وَعَنِ الْمَجْنُونِ حَتَّى يُفِيق»</p><p>(The pen does not record the deeds of three persons: the child until the age of puberty, the sleeping person until waking up, and the senile until sane.) Or, the age of fifteen is considered the age of adolescence. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn `Umar said, ""I was presented in front of the Prophet on the eve of the battle of Uhud, while I was fourteen years of age, and he did not allow me to take part in that battle. But I was presented in front of him on the eve of the battle of Al-Khandaq (The Trench) when I was fifteen years old, and he allowed me (to join that battle)."" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz commented when this Hadith reached him, ""This is the difference between a child and an adult."" There is a difference of opinion over whether pubic hair is considered a sign of adulthood, and the correct opinion is that it is. The Sunnah supports this view, according to a Hadith collected by Imam Ahmad from `Atiyah Al-Qurazi who said, We were presented to the Prophet on the day of Qurizah, whoever had pubic hair was killed, whoever did not was left free to go, I was one of those who did not, so I was left free."" The Four Sunan compilers also recorded similar to it. At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih."" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ رُشْداً فَادْفَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَلَهُمْ</p><p>(if then you find sound judgment in them, release their property to them,) Sa`id bin Jubayr said that this portion of the Ayah means, when you find them to be good in the religion and wise with their money. Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others among the Imams. The scholars of Fiqh stated that when the child becomes good in the religion and wise concerning with money, then the money that his caretaker was keeping for him should be surrendered to him.</p><h2>Poor Caretakers are Allowed to Wisely Spend from the Money of theOrphan Under Their Care, to Compensate for Their Work</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوهَآ إِسْرَافاً وَبِدَاراً أَن يَكْبَرُواْ</p><p>(But consume it not wastefully and hastily, fearing that they should grow up.) Allah commands that the money of the orphan should not be spent unnecessarily,</p><p>إِسْرَافاً وَبِدَاراً</p><p>(Wastefully and hastily) for fear they might grow up. Allah also commands,</p><p>وَمَن كَانَ غَنِيّاً فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ</p><p>(And whoever among guardians is rich, he should take no wages,) Hence, the guardian who is rich and does not need the orphan's money, should not take any of it as wages.</p><p>وَمَن كَانَ فَقِيراً فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</p><p>(but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A'ishah said, ""This Ayah,</p><p>وَمَن كَانَ غَنِيّاً فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ وَمَن كَانَ فَقِيراً فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</p><p>(And whoever among guardians is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable.) was revealed about the guardian of the orphan and pertains to whatever work he does for the orphan's estate. "" Al-Bukhari also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father said that his father told him that a man asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , ""I do not have money, but I have an orphan under my care."" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلْ مِنْ مَالِ يَتِيمِكَ غَيْرَ مُسْرِفٍ وَلَا مُبَذِّرٍ وَلَا مُتَأَثِّلٍ مَالًا، وَمِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ تَقِيَ مَالَكَ أَوْ قَالَ تَفْدِيَ مَالَكَ بِمَالِه»</p><p>(Eat from your orphan's wealth without extravagance or wastefulness, or mixing it, and without saving your money by spending his.)"" Allah said,</p><p>فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَلَهُمْ</p><p>(And when you release their property to them.) after they become adults, and you see that they are wise, then,</p><p>فَأَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(take a witness in their presence;) Allah commands the guardians of orphans to surrender the property of the orphans who become consenting adults, in the presence of witnesses, so that none of them denies the fact that he received his money. Allah said next,</p><p>وَكَفَى بِاللَّهِ حَسِيباً</p><p>(and Allah is All-Sufficient in taking account.) meaning, Allah is sufficient as Witness, Reckoner and Watcher over their work for orphans, and when they surrender their money to them, whether their property was complete and whole, or deficient and less. Indeed, Allah knows all of that. In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا أَبَا ذَرَ إِنِّي أَرَاكَ ضَعِيفًا، وَإِنِّي أُحِبُّ لَكَ مَا أُحِبُّ لِنَفْسِي، لَا تَأَمَّرَنَّ عَلَى اثْنَيْنِ، وَلَا تَلِيَنَّ مَالَ يَتِيم»</p><p>(O Abu Dharr! Verily, you are weak, and I love for you what I love for myself. Do not become a leader of two nor assume guardianship of an orphan's property.)</p>"
499,
500,"<h2>The Necessity of Surrendering the Inheritance According to the Portions that Allah Ordained</h2><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr and Qatadah said, ""The idolators used to give adult men a share of inheritance and deprive women and children of it. Allah revealed;</p><p>لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصيِبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَلِدَنِ وَالاٌّقْرَبُونَ</p><p>(There is a share for men from what is left by parents and those nearest in relation)."" Therefore, everyone is equal in Allah's decision to inherit, even though their shares vary according to the degree of their relationship to the deceased, whether being a relative, spouse, etc. Ibn Marduwyah reported that Jabir said, ""Umm Kujjah came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said to him, `O Messenger of Allah! I have two daughters whose father died, and they do not own anything.' So Allah revealed;</p><p>لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصيِبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَلِدَنِ وَالاٌّقْرَبُونَ</p><p>(There is a share for men from what is left by parents and those nearest in relation.)"" We will mention this Hadith when explaining the two Ayat about inheritance. Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p>وَإِذَا حَضَرَ الْقِسْمَةَ</p><p>(are present at the time of division,) those who do not have a share in the inheritance,</p><p>وَالْيَتَـمَى وَالْمَسَـكِينُ</p><p>(and the orphans and the poor), are also present upon dividing the inheritance, give them a share of the inheritance. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذَا حَضَرَ الْقِسْمَةَ أُوْلُواْ الْقُرْبَى وَالْيَتَـمَى وَالْمَسَـكِينُ</p><p>(And when the relatives and the orphans and the poor are present at the time of division), was not abrogated. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that this Ayah still applies and should be implemented. Ath-Thawri said that Ibn Abi Najih narrated from Mujahid that implementing this Ayah, ""Is required from those who have anything to inherit, paid from whatever portions their hearts are satisfied with giving away."" Similar explanation was reported from Ibn Mas`ud, Abu Musa, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ash-Sha`bi and Al-Hasan. Ibn Sirin, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Makhul, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Ata' bin Abi Rabah, Az-Zuhri and Yahya bin Ya`mar said this payment is obligatory. Others say that this refers to the bequeathal at the time of death. And others say that it was abrogated. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذَا حَضَرَ الْقِسْمَةَ</p><p>(And when are present at the time of division), refers to divisions of inheritance. So, when poor relatives, who are ineligible for inheritance, orphans, and the poor attend the division of the inheritance, which is sometimes substantial, their hearts will feel eager to have a share, seeing each eligible person assuming his share; while they are desperate, yet are not given anything. Allah the Most Kind, Most Compassionate, commands that they should have a share in the inheritance as an act of kindness, charity, compassion and mercy for them.</p><h2>Observing Fairness in the Will</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلْيَخْشَ الَّذِينَ لَوْ تَرَكُواْ مِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ</p><p>(And let those have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left behind...) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this part of the Ayah, ""Refers to a man who is near death and he dictates a will and testament that harms some of the rightful inheritors. Allah commands whoever hears such will to fear Allah, and direct the dying man to do what is right and to be fair, being as eager to protect the inheritors of the dying man as he would be with his own."" Similar was reported from Mujahid and several others. The Two Sahihs record that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ visited Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas during an illness he suffered from, Sa`d said to the Messenger, ""O Messenger of Allah! I am wealthy and have no inheritors except a daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity"" He said, ""No."" Sa`d asked, ""Half"" He said, ""No."" Sa`d said, ""One-third"" The Prophet said;</p><p>«الثُّلُثُ، وَالثُّلُثُ كَثِير»</p><p>(One-third, and even one-third is too much.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then said,</p><p>«إِنَّكَ أَنْ تَذَرَ وَرَثَتَكَ أَغْنِيَاءَ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَنْ تَذَرَهُمْ عَالَةً يَتَكَفَّفُونَ النَّاس»</p><p>(You'd better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging from others.)</p><h2>A Stern Warning Against Those Who Use Up the Orphan's Wealth</h2><p>It was also said that the Ayah</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوهَآ إِسْرَافاً وَبِدَاراً أَن يَكْبَرُواْ</p><p>(consume it not wastefully and hastily, fearing that they should grow up,) means, let them have Taqwa of Allah when taking care of the orphan's wealth, as Ibn Jarir recorded from Al-`Awfi who reported this explanation from Ibn `Abbas. This is a sound opinion that is supported by the warning that follows against consuming the orphan's wealth unjustly. In this case, the meaning becomes: Just as you would want your offspring to be treated fairly after you, then treat other people's offspring fairly when you are given the responsibility of caring for them. Allah proclaims that those who unjustly consume the wealth of orphans, will be eating fire into their stomach, this is why Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَلَ الْيَتَـمَى ظُلْماً إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِى بُطُونِهِمْ نَاراً وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيراً</p><p>(Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only a fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!) meaning, when you consume the orphan's wealth without a right, then you are only consuming fire, which will kindle in your stomach on the Day of Resurrection. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اجْتَنِبُوا السَّبْعَ الْمُوبِقَات»</p><p>(Avoid the seven great destructive sins. ) The people asked, ""O Allah's Messenger! What are they"" He said,</p><p>«الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ، وَالسِّحْرُ، وَقَتْلُ النَّفْسِ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ، وَأَكْلُ الرِّبَا، وَأَكْلُ مَالِ الْيَتِيمِ، وَالتَّوَلِّي يَوْمَ الزَّحْفِ، وَقَذْفُ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ الْغَافِلَات»</p><p>(To join others in worship along with Allah, magic, to kill the life which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause, to consume interest, to consume an orphan's property, to turn your back to the enemy and flee from the battlefield at the time of fighting, and to accuse chaste women who never even think of anything harmful to their chastity being good believers.)</p>"

670,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madina</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Ma'idah; When It was Revealed</h2><p>At-Tirmidhi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, ""The last Surahs to be revealed were Surat Al-Ma'idah and Surat Al-Fath (chapter 48)."" At-Tirmidhi commented, ""This Hadith is Hasan, Gharib."" and it was also reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the last Surah to be revealed was,</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p>(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest,) Al-Hakim collected a narration similar to that of At-Tirmidhi in his Mustadrak, and he said, ""It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Shaykhs and they did not record it."" Al-Hakim narrated that Jubayr bin Nufayr said, ""I performed Hajj once and visited `A'ishah and she said to me, `O Jubayr! Do you read (or memorize) Al-Ma'idah ' I answered `Yes.' She said, `It was the last Surah to be revealed. Therefore, whatever permissible matters you find in it, then consider (treat) them permissible. And whatever impermissible matters you find in it, then consider (treat) them impermissible.""' Al-Hakim said, ""It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Shaykhs and they did not record it. "" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi related that Mu`awiyah bin Salih added this statement in the last Hadith, ""I (Jubayr) also asked `A'ishah about the Messenger of Allah's ﷺ conduct and she answered by saying, `The Qur'an.""' An-Nasa'i also recorded it.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that a man came to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said to him, ""Advise me."" He said, ""When you hear Allah's statement,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</p><p>(O you who believe!) then pay full attention, for it is a righteous matter that He is ordaining or an evil thing that He is forbidding."" Khaythamah said, ""Everything in the Qur'an that reads,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</p><p>(O you who believe!) reads in the Tawrah, `O you who are in need.""' Allah said,</p><p>أَوْفُواْ بِالْعُقُودِ</p><p>(Fulfill (your) obligations.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that `obligations' here means treaties. Ibn Jarir mentioned that there is a consensus for this view. Ibn Jarir also said that it means treaties, such as the alliances that they used to conduct. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented:</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَوْفُواْ بِالْعُقُودِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations.) ""Refers to the covenants, meaning, what Allah permitted, prohibited, ordained and set limits for in the Qur'an. Therefore, do not commit treachery or break the covenants. Allah emphasized this command when He said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَـقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ</p><p>(And those who break the covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined,) until,</p><p>سُوءُ الدَّارِ</p><p>(unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).)"" Ad-Dahhak said that,</p><p>أَوْفُواْ بِالْعُقُودِ</p><p>(Fulfill your obligations.) ""Refers to what Allah has permitted and what He has prohibited. Allah has taken the covenant from those who proclaim their faith in the Prophet and the Book to fulfill the obligations that He has ordered for them in the permissible and the impermissible.""</p><h2>Explaining the Lawful and the Unlawful Beasts</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ الاٌّنْعَامِ</p><p>(Lawful to you (for food) are all the beasts of cattle) camels, cows and sheep, as Al-Hasan, Qatadah and several others stated. Ibn Jarir said that this Tafsir conforms to the meaning of (`beasts of cattle') that the Arabs had. We should mention that Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas and others relied on this Ayah as evidence to allow eating the meat of the fetus if it is found dead in the belly of its slaughtered mother. There is a Hadith to the same effect collected in the Sunan of Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and narrated by Abu Sa`id who said, ""We asked, `O Messenger of Allah! When we slaughter a camel, cow or sheep, we sometimes find a fetus in its belly, should we discard it or eat its meat' He said,</p><p>«كُلُوهُ إِنْ شِئْتُمْ فَإِنَّ ذَكَاتَهُ ذَكَاةُ أُمِّه»</p><p>(Eat it if you want, because its slaughter was fulfilled when its mother was slaughtered.)"" At-Tirmidhi said, ""This Hadith is Hasan."" Abu Dawud recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«ذَكَاةُ الْجَنِينِ ذَكَاةُ أُمِّه»</p><p>(Proper slaughter of the fetus is fulfilled with the slaughter of its mother.) Only Abu Dawud collected this narration. Allah's statement,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(except that which will be announced to you (herein), ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that it refers to, ""The flesh of dead animals, blood and the meat of swine."" Qatadah said, ""The meat of dead animals and animals slaughtered without Allah's Name being pronounced at the time of slaughtering."" It appears, and Allah knows best, that the Ayah refers to Allah's other statement,</p><p>حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةُ وَالْدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ الْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَالْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَالنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ</p><p>(Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maytah (the dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal.)5:3, for although the animals mentioned in this Ayah are types of permissible cattle (except for swine), they become impermissible under the circumstances that the Ayah 5:3 specifies. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى النُّصُبِ</p><p>(Unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone altars)) as the latter type is not permissible, because it can no longer be slaughtered properly. Hence, Allah's statement,</p><p>أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ الاٌّنْعَامِ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(Lawful to you are all the beasts of cattle except that which will be announced to you, ) means, except the specific circumstances that prohibit some of these which will be announced to you. Allah said,</p><p>غَيْرَ مُحِلِّى الصَّيْدِ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ</p><p>(game (also) being unlawful when you assume Ihram.) Some scholars said that the general meaning of `cattle' includes domesticated cattle, such as camels, cows and sheep, and wild cattle, such as gazzelle, wild cattle and wild donkeys. Allah made the exceptions mentioned above (dead animals blood, flesh of swine etc.), and prohibited hunting wild beasts while in the state of Ihram. It was also reported that the meaning here is, ""We have allowed for you all types of cattle in all circumstances, except what We excluded herewith for the one hunting game while in the state of Ihram."" Allah said,</p><p>فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, and not transgressing, then, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This Ayah means, ""We allowed eating the meat of dead animals, when one is forced by necessity, under the condition that one is not transgressing the limits or overstepping them."" Here, Allah states, ""Just as We allowed the meat of cattle in all conditions and circumstances, then do not hunt game when in the state of Ihram, for this is the decision of Allah, Who is the Most Wise in all that He commands and forbids."" So Allah said;</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ مَا يُرِيدُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah commands that which He wills.)</p><h2>The Necessity of Observing the Sanctity of the Sacred Area and the Sacred Months</h2><p>Allah continues,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُحِلُّواْ شَعَآئِرَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of Sha'a'ir Allah (the symbols of Allah),) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Sha`a'ir Allah means the rituals of Hajj."" Mujahid said, ""As-Safa and Al-Marwah, and the sacrificial animal are the symbols of Allah."" It was also stated that Sha`a'ir Allah is what He prohibited. Therefore, it means, do not violate what Allah prohibited. Allah said afterwards,</p><p>وَلاَ الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ</p><p>(nor of the Sacred Month,) for you are required to respect and honor the Sacred Month and to refrain from what Allah forbade during it, such as fighting. This also lays emphasis on avoiding sins during that time. As Allah said;</p><p>يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Month. Say, ""Fighting therein is a great (transgression)."") and,</p><p>إِنَّ عِدَّةَ الشُّهُورِ عِندَ اللَّهِ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْراً</p><p>(Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year). ) Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that Abu Bakrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said during the Farewell Hajj,</p><p>«إِنَّ الزَّمَانَ قَدِ اسْتَدَارَ كَهَيْئَتِهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ اللهُ السَّمَواتِ وَالْأَرْضَ السَّنَةُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا، مِنْهَا أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ، ثَلَاثٌ مُتَوَالِيَاتٌ: ذُو الْقَعْدَةِ وَذُو الْحِجَّةِ وَالْمُحَرَّمُ، وَرَجَبُ مُضَرَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ جُمَادَى وَشَعْبَان»</p><p>(The division of time has returned as it was when Allah created the Heavens and the earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred: Three are in succession, (they are:) Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha'ban.) This Hadith testifies to the continued sanctity of these months until the end of time.</p><h2>Taking the Hady to the Sacred House of Allah, Al-Ka`bah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ الْهَدْىَ وَلاَ الْقَلَـئِدَ</p><p>(nor of the Hady brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands,) means, do not abandon the practice of bringing the Hady (sacrificial animals) to the Sacred House, as this ritual is a form of honoring the symbols of Allah. Do not abandon the practice of garlanding these animals on their necks, so that they are distinguished from other cattle. This way, it will be known that these animals are intended to be offered as Hady at the Ka`bah, and thus those who might intend some harm to them would refrain from doing so. Those who see the Hady might be encouraged to imitate this ritual, and indeed, he who calls to a type of guidance, will earn rewards equal to the rewards of those who follow his lead, without decrease in their own rewards. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ intended to perform Hajj, he spent the night at Dhul-Hulayfah, which is also called Wadi Al-`Aqiq. In the morning, the Prophet made rounds with his wives, who were nine at that time, performed Ghusl (bath), applied some perfume and performed a two Rak`ah prayer. He then garlanded the Hady and announced aloud his intention to perform Hajj and `Umrah. The Prophet's Hady at the time consisted of plenty of camels, more than sixty, and they were among the best animals, the healthiest and most physically acceptable, just as Allah's statement proclaims,</p><p>ذلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَـئِرَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى الْقُلُوبِ</p><p>(Thus it is, and whosoever honors the symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said that Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ الْقَلَـئِدَ</p><p>(nor the garlands) means, ""Do not breach their sanctity."" During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to garland themselves with animal hair and pelts when they left their areas in months other than the Sacred Months. The idolators of the Sacred House Area used to garland themselves with the tree-stems of the Sacred Area, so that they were granted safe passage."" This statement was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim, who also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""There are two Ayat in this Surah (Al-Ma'idah) that were abrogated, the Ayah about the garlands 5:2, and</p><p>فَإِن جَآءُوكَ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So if they come to you (O Muhammad ), either judge between them, or turn away from them.)""</p><h2>The Necessity of Preserving the Sanctity and Safety of those who Intend to Travel to the Sacred House</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلا ءَامِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَناً</p><p>(nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.) The Ayah commands: Do not fight people who are heading towards the Sacred House of Allah, which if anyone enters it, he must be granted safe refuge. Likewise, those who are heading towards the Sacred House seeking the bounty and good pleasure of Allah, must not be stopped, prevented, or frightened away from entering the Sacred House. Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mutarrif bin `Abdullah, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and several others said that,</p><p>يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ</p><p>(seeking the bounty of their Lord.) refers to trading. A similar discussion preceded concerning the Ayah;</p><p>لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p>(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading).) Allah said;</p><p>وَرِضْوَناً</p><p>(and pleasure. ) Ibn `Abbas said that the word `pleasure' in the Ayah refers to, ""seeking Allah's pleasure by their Hajj."" `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir mentioned that this Ayah was revealed concerning Al-Hutam bin Hind Al-Bakri, who had raided the cattle belonging to the people of Al-Madinah. The following year, he wanted to perform `Umrah to the House of Allah and some of the Companions wanted to attack him on his way to the House. Allah revealed,</p><p>وَلا ءَامِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَناً</p><p>(nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.)</p><h2>Hunting Game is Permissible After Ihram Ends</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَـدُواْ</p><p>(But when you finish the Ihram, then hunt,) When you end your Ihram, it is permitted for you to hunt game, which was prohibited for you during Ihram. Although this Ayah contains a command that takes effect after the end of a state of prohibition (during Ihram in this case), the Ayah, in fact, brings back the ruling that was previously in effect. If the previous ruling was an obligation, the new command will uphold that obligation, and such is the case with recommended and permissible matters. There are many Ayat that deny that the ruling in such cases is always an obligation. Such is also the case against those who say that it is always merely allowed. What we mentioned here is the correct opinion that employs the available evidence, and Allah knows best.</p><h2>Justice is Always Necessary</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَن صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَن تَعْتَدُواْ</p><p>(and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).) The meaning of this Ayah is apparent, as it commands: Let not the hatred for some people, who prevented you from reaching the Sacred House in the year of Hudaybiyyah, make you transgress Allah's Law and commit injustice against them in retaliation. Rather, rule as Allah has commanded you, being just with every one. We will explain a similar Ayah later on,</p><p>وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p><p>(And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety,) which commands: do not be driven by your hatred for some people into abandoning justice, for justice is ordained for everyone, in all situations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his Companions were in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah when the idolators prevented them from visiting the House, and that was especially hard on them. Later on, some idolators passed by them from the east intending to perform `Umrah. So the Companions of the Prophet said, `Let us prevent those (from `Umrah) just as their fellow idolators prevented us.' Thereafter, Allah sent down this Ayah."" Ibn Abbas and others said that ""Shana'an"" refers to enmity and hate. Allah said next,</p><p>وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الْبرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلاَ تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</p><p>(Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.) Allah commands His believing servants to help one another perform righteous, good deeds, which is the meaning of `Al-Birr', and to avoid sins, which is the meaning of `At-Taqwa'. Allah forbids His servants from helping one another in sin, `Ithm' and committing the prohibitions. Ibn Jarir said that, ""Ithm means abandoning what Allah has ordained, while transgression means overstepping the limits that Allah set in your religion, along with overstepping what Allah has ordered concerning yourselves and others."" Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«انْصُرْ أَخَاكَ ظَالِمًا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا»</p><p>(Support your brother whether he was unjust or the victim of injustice.) He was asked, ""O Messenger of Allah! We know about helping him when he suffers injustice, so what about helping him when he commits injustice"" He said,</p><p>«تَحْجُزُهُ وَتَمْنَعُهُ مِنَ الظُّلْمِ فَذَاكَ نَصْرُه»</p><p>(Prevent and stop him from committing injustice, and this represents giving support to him.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith through Hushaym. Ahmad recorded that one of the Companions of the Prophet narrated the Hadith,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ الَّذِي يُخَالِطُ النَّاسَ وَيَصْبِرُ عَلَى أَذَاهُمْ أَعْظَمُ أَجْرًا مِنَ الَّذِي لَا يُخَالِطُ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَصْبِرُ عَلى أَذَاهُم»</p><p>(The believer who mingles with people and is patient with their annoyance, earns more reward than the believer who does not mingle with people and does not observe patience with their annoyance.) Muslim recorded a Hadith that states,</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ ذلِكَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا، وَمَنْ دَعَا إِلَى ضَلَالَةٍ كَانَ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْإِثْمِ مِثْلُ آثَامِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ، لَا يَنْقُصُ ذلِكَ مِنْ آثَامِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(He who calls to a guidance, will earn a reward similar to the rewards of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their rewards. Whoever calls to a heresy, will carry a burden similar to the burdens of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their own burdens.)</p>"
671,
672,"<h2>The Animals that are Unlawful to Eat</h2><p>Allah informs His servants that He forbids consuming the mentioned types of foods, such as the Maytah, which is the animal that dies before being properly slaughtered or hunted. Allah forbids this type of food due to the harm it causes, because of the blood that becomes clogged in the veins of the dead animal. Therefore, the Maytah is harmful, religiously and physically, and this is why Allah has prohibited it. The only exception to this ruling is fish, for fish is allowed, even when dead, by slaughtering or otherwise. Malik in his Muwatta, also Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah in their Sunan, Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban in their Sahihs, all recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about seawater. He said,</p><p>«هُوَ الطَّهُورُ مَاؤُهُ الْحِلُّ مَيْتَتُه»</p><p>(Its water is pure and its dead are permissible.) The same ruling applies to locusts, as proven in a Hadith that we will mention later. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالدَّمَ</p><p>(blood...) This refers to flowing blood, according to Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr, and it is similar to Allah's other statement,</p><p>دَمًا مَّسْفُوحًا</p><p>(Blood poured forth...) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas was asked about the spleen and he said, ""Eat it."" They said, ""It is blood."" He said, ""You are only prohibited blood that was poured forth."" Abu `Abdullah, Muhammad bin Idris Ash-Shafi`i recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُحِلَّ لَنَا مَيْتَتَانِ وَدَمَانِ، فَأَمَّا الْمَيْتَتَانِ فَالسَّمَكُ وَالْجَرَادُ، وَأَمَّا الدَّمَانِ فَالْكَبِدُ وَالِّطَحال»</p><p>(We were allowed two dead animals and two (kinds of) blood. As for the two dead animals, they are fish and locust. As for the two bloods, they are liver and spleen.) Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ibn Majah, Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi also recorded this Hadith through `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, who is a weak narrator. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَحْمَ الْخِنزِيرِ</p><p>(the flesh of swine...) includes domesticated and wild swine, and also refers to the whole animal, including its fat, for this is what the Arabs mean by Lahm or `flesh'. Muslim recorded that Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Al-Aslami said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ لَعِبَ بِالنَّرْدَشِيرِ، فَكَأَنَّمَا صَبَغَ يَدَهُ فِي لَحْمِ الْخِنْزِيرِ وَدَمِه»</p><p>(He who plays Nardshir (a game with dice that involves gambling) is just like the one who puts his hand in the flesh and blood of swine.) If this is the case with merely touching the flesh and blood of swine, so what about eating and feeding on it This Hadith is a proof that Lahm means the entire body of the animal, including its fat. In is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ حَرَّمَ بَيْعَ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْتَةِ وَالْخِنْزِيرِ وَالْأَصْنَام»</p><p>(Allah made the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols illegal.) The people asked, ""O Allah's Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lanterns"" He said,</p><p>«لَا، هُوَ حَرَام»</p><p>(No, it is illegal.) In the Sahih of Al-Bukhari, Abu Sufyan narrated that he said to Heraclius, Emperor of Rome, ""He (Muhammad) prohibited us from eating dead animals and blood."" Allah said,</p><p>وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ</p><p>(And that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah.) Therefore, the animals on which a name other than Allah was mentioned upon slaughtering it, is impermissible, because Allah made it necessary to mention His Glorious Name upon slaughtering the animals, which He created. Whoever does not do so, mentioning other than Allah's Name, such as the name of an idol, a false deity or a monument, when slaughtering, he makes this meat unlawful, according to the consensus. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ</p><p>(and that which has been killed by strangling...) either intentionally or by mistake, such as when an animal moves while restrained and dies by strangulation because of its struggling, this animal is also unlawful to eat.</p><p>وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ</p><p>(or by a violent blow...) This refers to the animal that is hit with a heavy object until it dies. Ibn `Abbas and several others said it is the animal that is hit with a staff until it dies. Qatadah said, ""The people of Jahiliyyah used to strike the animal with sticks and when it died, they would eat it."" It is recorded in the Sahih that `Adi bin Hatim said, ""I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! I use the Mi`rad for hunting and catch game with it.' He replied,</p><p>«إِذَا رَمَيْتَ بِالْمِعْرَاضِ فَخَزَق فَكُلْهُ، وَإِنْ أصَابَ بَعَرْضِهِ فَإنَّمَا هُوَ وَقِيذٌ فَلَا تَأْكُلْه»</p><p>(If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it. But, if it is hit by its broad side, do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death.) Therefore, the Prophet made a distinction between killing the animal with the sharp edge of an arrow or a hunting stick, and rendered it lawful, and what is killed by the broad side of an object, and rendered it unlawful because it was beaten to death. There is a consensus among the scholars of Fiqh on this subject. rAs for the animal that falls headlong from a high place and dies as a result, it is also prohibited. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that an animal that dies by a headlong fall, ""Is that which falls from a mountain."" Qatadah said that it is the animal that falls in a well. As-Suddi said that it is the animal that falls from a mountain or in a well. As for the animal that dies by being gorged by another animal, it is also prohibited, even if the horn opens a flesh wound and it bleeds to death from its neck. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَآ أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ</p><p>(and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal,) refers to the animal that was attacked by a lion, leopard, tiger, wolf or dog, then the wild beast eats a part of it and it dies because of that. This type is also prohibited, even if the animal bled to death from its neck. There is also a consensus on this ruling. During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to eat the sheep, camel, or cow that were partly eaten by a wild animal. Allah prohibited this practice for the believers. Allah's statement,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ</p><p>(unless you are able to slaughter it,) before it dies, due to the causes mentioned above. This part of the Ayah is connected to,</p><p>وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَالْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَالنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ</p><p>(and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ</p><p>(unless you are able to slaughter it, ) ""Unless you are able to slaughter the animal in the cases mentioned in the Ayah while it is still alive, then eat it, for it was properly slaughtered."" Similar was reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and As-Suddi. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""If you are able to slaughter the animal that has been hit by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the gorging of horns while it still moves a foot or a leg, then eat from its meat."" Similar was reported from Tawus, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ubayd bin `Umayr, Ad-Dahhak and several others, that if the animal that is being slaughtered still moves, thus demonstrating that it is still alive while slaughtering, then it is lawful. The Two Sahihs recorded that Rafi` bin Khadij said, ""I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals with reeds' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَا أَنْهَرَ الدَّمَ، وَذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ، فَكُلُوهُ، لَيْسَ السِّنَّ وَالظُّفُرَ، وَسَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ عَنْ ذلِكَ: أَمَّا السِّنُّ فَعَظْمٌ، وَأَمَّا الظُّفُرُ فَمُدَى الْحَبَشَة»</p><p>(You can use what makes blood flow and you can eat what is slaughtered with the Name of Allah. But do not use teeth or claws (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and claws are used by Ethiopians for slaughtering.)"" Allah said next,</p><p>وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى النُّصُبِ</p><p>(and that which is sacrificed on An-Nusub. ) Nusub were stone altars that were erected around the Ka`bah, as Mujahid and Ibn Jurayj stated. Ibn Jurayj said, ""There were three hundred and sixty Nusub around the Ka`bah that the Arabs used to slaughter in front of, during the time of Jahiliyyah. They used to sprinkle the animals that came to the Ka`bah with the blood of slaughtered animals, whose meat they cut to pieces and placed on the altars."" Allah forbade this practice for the believers. He also forbade them from eating the meat of animals that were slaughtered in the vicinity of the Nusub, even if Allah's Name was mentioned on these animals when they were slaughtered, because it is a type of Shirk that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden.</p><h2>The Prohibition of Using Al-Azlam for Decision Making</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُواْ بِالاٌّزْلاَمِ</p><p>((Forbidden) also is to make decisions with Al-Azlam) The Ayah commands, ""O believers! You are forbidden to use Al-Azlam (arrows) for decision making,"" which was a practice of the Arabs during the time of Jahiliyyah. They would use three arrows, one with the word `Do' written on it, another that says `Do not', while the third does not say anything. Some of them would write on the first arrow, `My Lord commanded me,' and, `My Lord forbade me,' on the second arrow and they would not write anything on the third arrow. If the blank arrow was picked, the person would keep trying until the arrow that says do or do not was picked, and the person would implement the command that he picked. Ibn `Abbas said that the Azlam were arrows that they used to seek decisions through. Muhammad bin Ishaq and others said that the major idol of the tribe of Quraysh was Hubal, which was erected on the tip of a well inside the Ka`bah, where gifts were presented and where the treasure of the Ka`bah was kept. There, they also had seven arrows that they would use to seek a decision concerning matters of dispute. Whatever the chosen arrow would tell them, they would abide by it! Al-Bukhari recorded that when the Prophet entered Al-Ka`bah (after Makkah was conquered), he found pictures of Ibrahim and Isma`il in it holding the Azlam in their hands. The Prophet commented,</p><p>«قَاتَلَهُمُ اللهُ لَقَدْ عَلِمُوا أَنَّهُمَا لَمْ يَسْتَقْسِمَا بِهَا أَبَدًا»</p><p>(May Allah fight them (the idolaters)! They know that they never used the Azlam to make decisions. ) Mujahid commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُواْ بِالاٌّزْلاَمِ</p><p>((Forbidden) also is to make decisions with Al-Azlam,) ""These were arrows that the Arabs used, and dice that the Persians and Romans used in gambling."" This statement by Mujahid, that these arrows were used in gambling, is doubtful unless we say that they used the arrows for gambling sometimes and for decisions other times, and Allah knows best. We should also state that Allah mentioned Azlam and gambling in His statement before the end of the Surah (5:90, 91),</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ - إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَآءَ فِى الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَعَنِ الصَّلَوةِ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam are an abomination of Shaytan's handiwork. So avoid that in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the Salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain) In this Ayah, Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُواْ بِالاٌّزْلاَمِ ذَلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ</p><p>((Forbidden) also is to make decisions with Al-Azlam, (all) that is Fisq.) meaning, all these practices constitute disobedience, sin, misguidance, ignorance and, above all, Shirk. Allah has commanded the believers to seek decisions from Him when they want to do something, by first worshipping Him and then asking Him for the best decision concerning the matter they seek. Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and the collectors of Sunan recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, ""The Prophet used to teach us how to make Istikharah (asking Allah to guide one to the right action), in all matters, as he taught us the Surahs of the Qur'an. He said,</p><p>«إِذَا هَمَّ أَحَدُكُمْ بِالْأَمْرِ فَلْيَرْكَعْ رَكْعَتَيْنِ مِنْ غَيْرِ الْفَرِيضَةِ، ثُمَّ لْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ، وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ، وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ الْعَظِيمِ، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ، وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمُرَ ويسميه باسمه خَيْرٌ لِي فِي دِينِي وَدُنْيَايَ وَمَعَاشِي وعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ: عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي، وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي، ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ، اللَّهُمَّ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَدُنْيَايَ وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي، فَاصْرِفْنِي عَنْهُ، وَاصْرِفْهُ عَنِّي، وَاقْدُرْ لِيَ الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ، ثُمَّ رَضِّنِي بِه»</p><p>(If anyone of you thinks of doing any matter, he should offer a two Rak'ah prayer, other than the compulsory, and say (after the prayer) `O Allah! I ask guidance from Your knowledge, from Your ability and I ask for Your great bounty, for You are capable and I am not, You know and I do not, and You know the Unseen. O Allah! If You know that this matter (and one should mention the matter or deed here) is good for my religion, my livelihood and the Hereafter (or he said, `for my present and later needs') then ordain it for me, make it easy for me to have, and then bless it for me. O Allah! And if You know that this is harmful to me in my religion and livelihood and for the Hereafter then keep it away from me and let me be away from it. And ordain whatever is good for me, and make me satisfied with it.') This is the wording collected by Ahmad, and At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih Gharib.""</p><h2>Shaytan and the Disbelievers Do Not Hope that Muslims Will Ever Follow Them</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>الْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن دِينِكُمْ</p><p>(This day, those who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion;) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, ""They gave up hope that Muslims would revert to their religion."" This is similar to the saying of `Ata' bin Abi Rabah, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan. This meaning is supported by a Hadith recorded in the Sahih that states,</p><p>«إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ قَدْ يَئِسَ أَنْ يَعْبُدَهُ الْمُصَلُّونَ فِي جَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَلكِنْ بِالتَّحْرِيشِ بَيْنَهُم»</p><p>(Verily, Shaytan has given up hope that those who pray in the Arabian Peninsula, will worship him. But he will still stir trouble among them.) It is also possible that the Ayah negates the possibility that the disbelievers and Shaytan will ever be like Muslims, since Muslims have various qualities that contradict Shirk and its people. This is why Allah commanded His believing servants to observe patience, to be steadfast in defying and contradicting the disbelievers, and to fear none but Allah. Allah said,</p><p>فَلاَ تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِ</p><p>(So fear them not, but fear Me.) meaning, `do not fear them when you contradict them. Rather, fear Me and I will give you victory over them, I will eradicate them, and make you prevail over them, I will please your hearts and raise you above them in this life and the Hereafter.'</p><h2>Islam Has Been Perfected For Muslims</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الأِسْلاَمَ دِيناً</p><p>(This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.) This, indeed, is the biggest favor from Allah to this Ummah, for He has completed their religion for them, and they, thus, do not need any other religion or any other Prophet except Muhammad . This is why Allah made Muhammad ﷺ the Final Prophet and sent him to all humans and Jinn. Therefore, the permissible is what he allows, the impermissible is what he prohibits, the Law is what he legislates and everything that he conveys is true and authentic and does not contain lies or contradictions. Allah said;</p><p>وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</p><p>(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice,) meaning, it is true in what it conveys and just in what it commands and forbids. When Allah completed the religion for Muslims, His favor became complete for them as well. Allah said,</p><p>الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الأِسْلاَمَ دِيناً</p><p>(This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.) meaning, accept Islam for yourselves, for it is the religion that Allah likes and which He chose for you, and it is that with which He sent the best of the honorable Messengers and the most glorious of His Books. Ibn Jarir recorded that Harun bin `Antarah said that his father said, ""When the Ayah,</p><p>الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</p><p>(This day, I have perfected your religion for you...) was revealed, during the great day of Hajj (the Day of `Arafah, the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah) `Umar cried. The Prophet said, `What makes you cry' He said, `What made me cry is that our religion is being perfected for us. Now it is perfect, nothing is perfect, but it is bound to deteriorate.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«صَدَقْت»</p><p>(You have said the truth.)"" What supports the meaning of this Hadith is the authentic Hadith,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْإِسْلَامَ بَدَأَ غَرِيبًا، وَسَيَعُودُ غَرِيبًا، فَطُوبَى لِلْغُرَبَاء»</p><p>(Islam was strange in its beginning and will return strange once more. Therefore, Tuba for the strangers.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Tariq bin Shihab said, ""A Jewish man said to `Umar bin Al-Khattab, `O Leader of the Believers! There is a verse in your Book, which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed) as a day of celebration.' `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, `Which is that verse' The Jew replied, s</p><p>الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى</p><p>(This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you...) `Umar replied, `By Allah! I know when and where this verse was revealed to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. It was the evening on the Day of `Arafah on a Friday.""' Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith through Al-Hasan bin As-Sabbah from Ja`far bin `Awn. Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. In the narration collected by Al-Bukhari in the book of Tafsir, through Tariq, he said, ""The Jews said to `Umar, `By Allah! There is a verse that is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed) as a day of celebration.' `Umar said, `By Allah! I know when and where this verse was revealed and where the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was at that time. It was the day of `Arafah, and I was at `Arafah, by Allah."" Sufyan (one of the narrators) doubted if Friday was mentioned in this narration. Sufyan's confusion was either because he was unsure if his teacher included this statement in the Hadith or not. Otherwise, if it was because he doubted that the particular day during the Farewell Hajj was a Friday, it would be a mistake that could not and should not have come from someone like Sufyan Ath-Thawri. The fact that it was a Friday, is agreed on by the scholars of Sirah and Fiqh. There are numerous Hadiths that support this fact that are definitely authentic and of the Mutawatir type. This Hadith was also reported from `Umar through various chains of narration.</p><h2>Permitting the Dead Animals in Conditions of Necessity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ فِى مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لإِثْمٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above mentioned animals), then surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Therefore, when one is forced to take any of the impermissible things that Allah mentioned to meet a necessity, he is allowed and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful with him. Allah is well aware of His servant's needs during dire straits, and He will forgive and pardon His servant in this case. In the Musnad and the Sahih of Ibn Hibban, it is recorded that Ibn `Umar said that Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إنَّ اللهَ يُحِبُّ أَنْ تُؤْتَى رُخْصَتُهُ كَمَا يَكْرَهُ أَنْ تُؤْتَى مَعْصِيَتُه»</p><p>(Allah likes that His Rukhsah (allowance) be used, just as He dislikes that disobedience to Him is committed.) We should mention here that it is not necessary for one to wait three days before eating the meat of dead animals, as many unlettered Muslims mistakenly think. Rather, one can eat such meat when the dire need arises. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi said that the Companions asked, ""O Messenger of Allah! We live in a land where famine often strikes us. Therefore, when are we allowed to eat the meat of dead animals"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«إِذَا لَمْ تَصْطَبِحُوا، وَلَمْ تَغْتَبِقُوا،وَلَمْ تَخْتَفِئُوا بَقْلًا فَشَأْنُكُمْ بِهَا»</p><p>(When you neither find food for lunch and dinner nor have any produce to eat, then eat from it.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this narration and its chain meets the criteria of the Two Sahihs. Allah said,</p><p>غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لإِثْمٍ</p><p>(with no inclination to sin,) meaning, one does not incline to commit what Allah has prohibited. Allah has allowed one when necessity arises to eat from what He otherwise prohibits, under the condition that his heart does not incline to eat what Allah prohibited. Allah said in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Some scholars used this Ayah as evidence that those who travel for the purpose of committing an act of disobedience are not allowed to use any of the legal concessions of travel, because these concessions are not earned through sin, and Allah knows best.</p>"
673,"<h2>Clarifying the Lawful</h2><p>In the previous Ayah Allah mentioned the prohibited types of food, the impure and unclean things, harmful for those who eat them, either to their bodies, religion or both, except out of necessity,</p><p>وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُم مَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلاَّ مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ</p><p>(while He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity) After that, Allah said,</p><p>يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَآ أُحِلَّ لَهُمْ قُلْ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَـتُ</p><p>(They ask you what is lawful for them. Say, ""Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibat..."") In Surat Al-A`raf Allah describes Muhammad allowing the good things and prohibiting the filthy things. Muqatil said, ""At-Tayyibat includes everything Muslims are allowed and the various types of legally earned provision."" Az-Zuhri was once asked about drinking urine for medicinal purposes and he said that it is not a type of Tayyibat."" Ibn Abi Hatim also narrated this statement. Using Jawarih to Hunt Game is Permissible Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا عَلَّمْتُمْ مِّنَ الْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ</p><p>(And those Jawarih (beasts and birds of prey) which you have trained as hounds...) That is, lawful for you are the animals slaughtered in Allah's Name, and the good things for sustenance. The game you catch with the Jawarih are also lawful for you. This refers to trained dogs and falcons, as is the opinion of the majority of the Companions, their followers, and the Imams. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>وَمَا عَلَّمْتُمْ مِّنَ الْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ</p><p>(And those Jawarih (beasts and birds of prey) which you have trained as hounds...) refers to trained hunting dogs, falcons and all types of birds and beasts that are trained to hunt, including dogs, wild cats, falcons, and so forth. Ibn Abi Hatim collected this and said, ""Similar was reported from Khaythamah, Tawus, Mujahid, Makhul and Yahya bin Abi Kathir."" Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Umar said, ""You are permitted the animal that the trained birds, such as falcons, hunt for you if you catch it (before it eats from it). Otherwise, do not eat from it."" I say, the majority of scholars say that hunting with trained birds is just like hunting with trained dogs, because bird's of prey catch the game with their claws, just like dogs. Therefore, there is no difference between the two. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Adi bin Hatim said that he asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the game that the falcon hunts and the Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْكَ فَكُل»</p><p>(Whatever it catches for you, eat from it.) These carnivores that are trained to catch game are called Jawarih in Arabic, a word that is derived from Jarh, meaning, what one earns. The Arabs would say, ""So-and-so has Jaraha something good for his family,"" meaning, he has earned them something good. The Arabs would say, ""So-and-so does not have a Jarih for him,"" meaning, a caretaker. Allah also said,</p><p>وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِالنَّهَارِ</p><p>(And He knows what you have done during the day...) meaning, the good or evil you have earned or committed. Allah's statement,</p><p>مُكَلِّبِينَ</p><p>(trained as hounds,) those Jawarih that have been trained to hunt as hounds with their claws or talons. Therefore, if the game is killed by the weight of its blow, not with its claws, then we are not allowed to eat from the game. Allah said,</p><p>تُعَلِّمُونَهُنَّ مِمَّا عَلَّمَكُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p>(training them in the manner as directed to you by Allah, ) as when the beast is sent, it goes after the game, and when it catches it, it keeps it until its owner arrives and does not catch it to eat it itself. This is why Allah said here,</p><p>فَكُلُواْ مِمَّآ أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(so eat of what they catch for you, but pronounce the Name of Allah over it,) When the beast is trained, and it catches the game for its owner who mentioned Allah's Name when he sent the beast after the game, then this game is allowed according to the consensus of scholars, even if it was killed. There are Hadiths in the Sunnah that support this statement. The Two Sahihs recorded that `Adi bin Hatim said, ""I said, `O Allah's Messenger! I send hunting dogs and mention Allah's Name.' He replied,</p><p>«إِذَا أَرْسَلْتَ كَلْبَكَ الْمُعَلَّمَ وَذَكَرْتَ اسْمَ اللهِ فَكُلْ مَا أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْك»</p><p>(If, with mentioning Allah's Name, you let loose your tamed dog after a game and it catches it, you may eat what it catches.) I said, `Even if it kills the game' He replied,</p><p>«وَإِنْ قَتَلْنَ، مَا لَمْ يَشْرَكْهَا كَلْبٌ لَيْسَ مِنْهَا، فَإِنَّكَ إِنَّمَا سَمَّيْتَ عَلى كَلْبِكَ وَلَمْ تُسَمِّ عَلى غَيْرِه»</p><p>(Even if it kills the game, unless another dog joins the hunt, for you mentioned Allah's Name when sending your dog, but not the other dog.) I said, `I also use the Mi`rad and catch game with it.' He replied,</p><p>«إِذَا رَمَيْتَ بِالْمِعْرَاضِ فَخَزقَ فَكُلْهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ بِعَرْضٍ فَإِنَّهُ وَقِيذٌ فَلَا تَأْكُلْه»</p><p>(If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it, but if it is hit by its broad side, do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death.) In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«وَإِذَا أَرْسَلْتَ كَلْبَكَ فَاذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللهِ، فَإِنْ أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْكَ، فَأَدْرَكْتَهُ حَيًّا فَاذْبَحُهُ، وَإِنْ أَدْرَكْتَهُ قَدْ قَتَلَ وَلَمْ يَأْكُلْ مِنْهُ فَكُلْهُ، فَإِنَّ أَخْذَ الْكَلْبِ ذَكَاتُه»</p><p>(If you send your hunting dog, then mention Allah's Name and whatever it catches for you and you find alive, slaughter it. If you catch the game dead and the dog did not eat from it, then eat from it, for the dog has caused its slaughter to be fulfilled.) In yet another narration of two Sahihs, the Prophet said,</p><p>«فَإِنْ أَكَلَ فَلَا تَأْكُلْ، فَإِنِّي أَخَافُ أَنْ يَكُونَ أَمْسَكَ عَلى نَفْسِه»</p><p>(If the dog eats from the game, do not eat from it for I fear that it has caught it as prey for itself.)</p><h2>Mention Allah's Name Upon Sending the Predators to Catch the Game</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَكُلُواْ مِمَّآ أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(so eat of what they catch for you, but pronounce the Name of Allah over it,) meaning, upon sending it. The Prophet said to `Adi bin Hatim,</p><p>«إِذَا أَرَسَلْتَ كَلْبَكَ الْمُعَلَّمَ، وَذَكَرْتَ اسْمَ اللهِ، فَكُلْ مَا أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْك»</p><p>(When you send your trained dog and mention Allah's Name, eat from what it catches for you.) It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Tha`labah related that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِذَا أَرْسَلْتَ كَلْبَكَ فَاذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللهِ، وَإِذَا رَمَيْتَ بِسَهْمِكَ فَاذْكُرِ اسْمَ الله»</p><p>(If you send your hunting dog, mention Allah's Name over it. If you shoot an arrow, mention Allah's Name over it.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(but pronounce the Name of Allah over it,) ""When you send a beast of prey, say, `In the Name of Allah!' If you forget, then there is no harm."" It was also reported that this Ayah commands mentioning Allah's Name upon eating. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ taught his stepson `Umar bin Abu Salamah saying,</p><p>«سَمِّ اللهَ وَكُلْ بِيَمِينِكَ وَكُلْ مِمَّا يَلِيك»</p><p>(Mention Allah's Name, eat with your right hand and eat from the part of the plate that is in front of you.) Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, ""They asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Some people, - recently converted from disbelief - bring us some meats that we do not know if Allah's Name was mentioned over or not.' He replied,</p><p>«سَمُّوا اللهَ أَنْتُمْ وَكُلُوا»</p><p>(Mention Allah's Name on it and eat from it.)""</p>"
674,"<h2>Permitting the Slaughtered Animals of the People of the Book</h2><p>After Allah mentioned the filthy things that He prohibited for His believing servants and the good things that He allowed for them, He said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">الْيَوْمَ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَـتُ</div><p>(Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat.) Allah then mentioned the ruling concerning the slaughtered animals of the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَطَعَامُ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(The food of the People of the Scripture is lawful to you..) meaning, their slaughtered animals, as Ibn `Abbas, Abu Umamah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Makhul, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan stated. This ruling, that the slaughtered animals of the People of the Book are permissible for Muslims, is agreed on by the scholars, because the People of the Book believe that slaughtering for other than Allah is prohibited. They mention Allah's Name upon slaughtering their animals, even though they have deviant beliefs about Allah that do not befit His majesty. It is recorded in the Sahih that `Abdullah bin Mughaffal said, ""While we were attacking the fort of Khaybar, a person threw a leather bag containing fat, and I ran to take it and said, `I will not give anyone anything from this container today.' But when I turned I saw the Prophet (standing behind) while smiling."" The scholars rely on this Hadith as evidence that we are allowed to eat what we need of foods from the booty before it is divided. The scholars of the Hanafi, the Shafi`i and the Hanbali Madhhabs rely on this Hadith to allow eating parts of the slaughtered animals of the Jews that they prohibit for themselves, such as the fat. They used this Hadith as evidence against the scholars of the Maliki Madhhab who disagreed with this ruling. A better proof is the Hadith recorded in the Sahih that the people of Khaybar gave the Prophet a gift of a roasted leg of sheep, which they poisoned. The Prophet used to like eating the leg of the sheep and he took a bite from it, but it told the Prophet that it was poisoned, so he discarded that bite. The bite that the Prophet took effected the palate of his mouth, while Bishr bin Al-Bara' bin Ma`rur died from eating from that sheep. The Prophet had the Jewish woman, Zaynab, who poisoned the sheep, killed. Therefore, the Prophet and his Companions wanted to eat from that sheep and did not ask the Jews if they removed what the Jews believed was prohibited for them, such as its fat. Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَطَعَامُكُمْ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ</div><p>(and your food is lawful to them.) means, you are allowed to feed them from your slaughtered animals. Therefore, this part of the Ayah is not to inform the People of the Scriptures that they are allowed to eat our food -- unless we consider it information for us about the ruling that they have -- i. e, that they are allowed all types of foods over which Allah's Name was mentioned, whether slaughtered according to their religion or otherwise. The first explanation is more plausible. So it means: you are allowed to feed them from your slaughtered animals just as you are allowed to eat from theirs, as equal compensation and fair treatment. The Prophet gave his robe to `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, who was wrapped with it when he died. They say that he did that because `Abdullah had given his robe to Al-`Abbas when Al-`Abbas came to Al-Madinah. As for the Hadith,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«لَا تَصْحَبْ إِلَّا مُؤْمِنًا، وَلَا يَأْكُلْ طَعَامَكَ إِلَّا تَقِي»</div><p>(Do not befriend but a believer, nor should other than a Taqi (pious person) eat your food.), This is to encourage such behavior, and Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Permission to Marry Chaste Women From the People of the Scriptures</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالْمُحْصَنَـتُ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنَـتِ</div><p>((Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers) The Ayah states: you are allowed to marry free, chaste believing women. This Ayah is talking about women who do not commit fornication, as evident by the word `chaste'. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مُحْصَنَـت غَيْرَ مُسَـفِحَـتٍ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذَاتِ أَخْدَانٍ</div><p>(Desiring chastity not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as boyfriends (lovers).) 4:25 `Abdullah Ibn `Umar used to advise against marrying Christian women saying, ""I do not know of a worse case of Shirk than her saying that `Isa is her lord, while Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ تَنْكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَـتِ حَتَّى يُؤْمِنَّ</div><p>(And do not marry idolatresses till they believe.)"" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ghifari said that Ibn `Abbas said that when this Ayah was revealed,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ تَنْكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَـتِ حَتَّى يُؤْمِنَّ</div><p>(And do not marry idolatresses till they believe,) the people did not marry the pagan women. When the following Ayah was revealed,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالْمُحْصَنَـتُ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ</div><p>((Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture before your time) they married women from the People of the Book. "" Some of the Companions married Christian women and did not see any problem in this, relying on the honorable Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالْمُحْصَنَـتُ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ</div><p>((Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from those who were given the Scripture before your time) Therefore, they made this Ayah an exception to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ تَنْكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَـتِ حَتَّى يُؤْمِنَّ</div><p>(And do not marry the idolatresses till they believe,) considering the latter Ayah to include the People of the Book in its general meaning. Otherwise, there is no contradiction here, since the People of the Book were mentioned alone when mentioning the rest of the idolators. Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَمْ يَكُنِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ وَالْمُشْرِكِينَ مُنفَكِّينَ حَتَّى تَأْتِيَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ </div><p>(Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and the idolators, were not going to leave (their disbelief) until there came to them clear evidence.) and,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ وَالاٍّمِّيِّينَ ءَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ</div><p>(And say to those who were given the Scripture and to those who are illiterates: ""Do you (also) submit yourselves"" If they do, they are rightly guided.) Allah said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِذَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ</div><p>(When you have given them their due), This refers to the Mahr, so just as these women are chaste and honorable, then give them their Mahr with a good heart. We should mention here that Jabir bin `Abdullah, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Al-Hasan Al-Basri stated that when a man marries a woman and she commits illegal sexual intercourse before the marriage is consummated, the marriage is annulled. In this case, she gives back the Mahr that he paid her. Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذِى أَخْدَانٍ</div><p>(Desiring chastity, not illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girl-friends (or lovers).) And just as women must be chaste and avoid illegal sexual activity, such is the case with men, who must also be chaste and honorable. Therefore, Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ</div><p>(...not illegal sexual intercourse') as adulterous people do, those who do not avoid sin, nor reject adultery with whomever offers it to them.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ مُتَّخِذِى أَخْدَانٍ</div><p>(nor taking them as girl-friends (or lovers),) meaning those who have mistresses and girlfriends who commit illegal sexual intercourse with them, as we mentioned in the explanation of Surat An-Nisa'.</p>"
675,"<h2>The Order to Perform Wudu</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلوةِ</p><p>(When you stand for (intend to offer) the Salah,) Allah commanded performing Wudu' for the prayer. This is a command of obligation in the case of impurity, and in the case of purity, it is merely a recommendation. It was said that in the beginning of Islam, Muslims had to perform Wudu' for every prayer, but later on, this ruling was abrogated. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Sulayman bin Buraydah said that his father said, ""The Prophet used to perform Wudu' before every prayer. On the Day of Victory, he performed Wudu' and wiped on his Khuffs and prayed the five prayers with one Wudu'. `Umar said to him, `O Messenger of Allah! You did something new that you never did before.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إني عمدا فعلته يا عمر»</p><p>(`I did that intentionally O `Umar!)""' Muslim and the collectors of the Sunan also recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said,""Hasan Sahih."" Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Fadl bin Al-Mubashshir said, ""I saw Jabir bin `Abdullah perform several prayers with only one Wudu'. When he would answer the call of nature, he performed Wudu' and wiped the top of his Khuffs with his wet hand. I said, `O Abu `Abdullah! Do you do this according to your own opinion' He said, `Rather, I saw the Prophet do the same thing. So, I do what I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ doing.""' Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith. Ahmad recorded that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Umar was asked; ""Did you see `Abdullah bin `Umar perform Wudu' for every prayer, whether he was in a state of purity or not,"" So he replied, ""Asma' bint Zayd bin Al-Khattab told him that `Abdullah bin Hanzalah bin Abi `Amir Al-Ghasil told her that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was earlier commanded to perform Wudu' for every prayer, whether he needed it or not. When that became hard on him, he was commanded to use Siwak for every prayer, and to perform Wudu' when Hadath (impurity) occurs. `Abdullah (Ibn `Umar) thought that he was able to do that (perform Wudu' for every prayer) and he kept doing that until he died."" Abu Dawud also collected this narration. This practice by Ibn `Umar demonstrates that it is encouraged, not obligatory, to perform Wudu' for every prayer, and this is also the opinion of the majority of scholars. Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ once left the area where he answered the call of nature, he was brought something to eat. They said, ""Should we bring you your water for Wudu"" He said,</p><p>«إنَّمَا أُمِرْتُ بِالْوُضُوءِ إِذَا قُمْتُ إِلَى الصَّلَاة»</p><p>(I was commanded to perform Wudu' when I stand up for prayer.) At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith and At-Tirmidhi said, ""This Hadith is Hasan."" Muslim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""We were with the Prophet when he went to answer the call of nature and when he came back, he was brought some food. He was asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Do you want to perform Wudu"" He said,</p><p>«لِمَ؟ أَأُصَلِي فَأَتَوَضَّأ»</p><p>(`Why Am I about to pray so that I have to make Wudu'.)""'</p><h2>The Intention and Mentioning Allah's Name for Wudu</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ</p><p>(then wash your faces...) The obligation for the intention before Wudu' is proven by this Ayah;</p><p>إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلوةِ فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ</p><p>(When you stand (intend) to offer the Salah then wash your faces...) This is because it is just like the Arabs saying; ""When you see the leader, then stand."" Meaning stand for him. And the Two Sahihs recorded the Hadith,</p><p>«الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّــيَّاتِ وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِىءٍ مَانَوَى»</p><p>(Actions are judged by their intentions, and each person will earn what he intended.) It is also recommended before washing the face that one mentions Allah's Name for the Wudu'. A Hadith that was narrated by several Companions states that the Prophet said, n</p><p>«لَا وُضْوءَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللهِ عَلَيْه»</p><p>(There is no Wudu' for he who does not mention Allah's Name over it.) It is also recommended that one washes his hands before he puts his hands in the vessel of water, especially after one wakes up from sleep, for the Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا اسْتَيْقَظَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ نَوْمِهِ فَلَا يُدْخِلْ يَدَهُ فِي الْإِنَاءِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَغْسِلَهَا ثَلَاثًا، فَإِنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ لَا يَدْرِي أَيْنَ بَاتَتْ يَدُه»</p><p>(If one of you wakes up from his sleep, let him not put his hand in the pot until he washes it thrice, for one of you does not know where his hand spent the night.) The face according to the scholars of Fiqh starts where the hair line on the head starts, regardless of one's lack or abundance of hair, until the end of the cheeks and chin, and from ear to ear.</p><h2>Passing the Fingers through the Beard While Performing Wudu</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Wa'il said, ""I saw `Uthman when he was performing Wudu'... When he washed his face, he passed his fingers through his beard three times. He said, `I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ do what you saw me doing.""' At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said ""Hasan Sahih."" while Al-Bukhari graded it Hasan.</p><h2>How to Perform Wudu</h2><p>mam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas once performed Wudu' and took a handful of water and rinsed his mouth and nose with it. He took another handful of water and joined both hands and washed his face. He took another handful of water and washed his right hand, and another handful and washed his left hand with it. He next wiped his head. Next, he took a handful of water and sprinkled it on his right foot and washed it and took another handful of water and washed his left foot. When he finished, he said, ""This is how I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (performing Wudu')."" Al-Bukhari also recorded it. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ</p><p>(and your hands (forearms) up to (Ila) the elbows...) meaning, including the elbows. Allah said in another Ayah using Ila,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَلَهُمْ إِلَى أَمْوَلِكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوباً كَبِيراً</p><p>(And devour not their substance to (Ila) your substance (by adding or including it in your property). Surely, this is a great sin.) It is recommended that those who perform Wudu' should wash a part of the upper arm with the elbow. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أُمَّتِي يُدْعَوْنَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ غُرًّا مُحَجَّلِينَ مِنْ آثَارِ الْوُضُوءِ، فَمَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمْ أَنْ يُطِيلَ غُرَّتَهُ فَلْيَفْعَل»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, my Ummah will be called ""those with the radiant appendages"" because of the traces of Wudu'. Therefore, whoever can increase the area of his radiance should do so.) Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""I heard my intimate friend (the Messenger ) saying,</p><p>«تَبْلُغُ الْحِلْيَةُ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ حَيْثُ يَبْلُغُ الْوَضُوء»</p><p>(The radiance of the believer reaches the areas that the water of (his) Wudu' reaches.)"" Allah said next,</p><p>وَامْسَحُواْ بِرُؤُوسِكُمْ</p><p>(Rub your heads.) It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Malik bin `Amr bin Yahya Al-Mazini said that his father said that a man said to `Abdullah bin Zayd bin `Asim, the grandfather of `Amr bin Yahya and one of the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ, ""Can you show me how the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to perform Wudu""' `Abdullah bin Zayd said, ""Yes."" He then asked for a pot of water. He poured from it on his hands and washed them twice, then he rinsed his mouth and washed his nose with water thrice by putting water in it and blowing it out. He washed his face thrice and after that he washed his forearms up to the elbows twice. He then passed his wet hands over his head from its front to its back and vice versa, beginning from the front and taking them to the back of his head up to the nape of the neck and then brought them to the front again from where he had started. He next washed his feet. A similar description of the Wudu' of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was performed by `Ali in the Hadith by `Abdu Khayr. Abu Dawud recorded that Mu`awiyah and Al-Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib narrated similar descriptions of the Wudu' of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. These Hadiths indicate that it is necessary to wipe the entire head. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Humran bin Aban said, ""I saw `Uthman bin `Affan performing Wudu', and he poured water over his hands and washed them thrice, and then rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it, and then blowing it out. Then he washed his face thrice, and then his right forearm up to the elbows thrice, and washed the left forearm thrice. Then he passed his wet hands over his head, then he washed his right foot thrice, and next his left foot thrice. After that `Uthman said, `I saw the Prophet performing Wudu' like this, and said,</p><p>«مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ نَحْوَ وُضُوئِي هَذَا، ثُمَّ صَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ لَا يُحَدِّثُ فِيهِمَا نَفْسَهُ، غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه»</p><p>(If anyone performs Wudu' like that of mine and offers a two-Rak`ah prayer during which he does not think of anything else, then his past sins will be forgiven.)""' Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded this Hadith in the Two Sahihs. In his Sunan, Abu Dawud also recorded it from `Uthman, under the description of Wudu', and in it, that he wiped his head one time.</p><h2>The Necessity of Washing the Feet</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَينِ</p><p>(and your feet up to ankles.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas stated that the Ayah refers to washing (the feet). `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, `Urwah, `Ata', `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ibrahim, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Az-Zuhri and Ibrahim At-Taymi said similarly. This clearly indicates the necessity of washing the feet, just as the Salaf have said, and not only wiping over the top of the bare foot.</p><h2>The Hadiths that Indicate the Necessity of Washing the Feet</h2><p>We mentioned the Hadiths by the two Leaders of the Faithful, `Uthman and `Ali, and also by Ibn `Abbas, Mu`awiyah, `Abdullah bin Zayd bin `Asim and Al-Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ washed his feet for Wudu', either once, twice or thrice. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was once late during a trip we were taking, and he caught up with us when the time remaining for the `Asr prayer was short. We were still performing Wudu' (in a rush) and we were wiping our feet. He shouted at the top of his voice,</p><p>«أَسْبِغُوا الْوُضُوءَ وَيْلٌ لِلْأَعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّار»</p><p>(Perform Wudu' thoroughly. Save your heels from the Fire.)"" The same narration was also collected in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah. Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«أَسْبِغُوا الْوُضُوءَ وَيْلٌ لِلْأَعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّار»</p><p>(Perform Wudu' thoroughly. Save your heels from the Fire.) `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Jaz' said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«وَيْلٌ لِلْأَعْقَابِ وَبُطُونِ الْأَقْدَامِ مِنَ النَّار»</p><p>(Save your heels and the bottom of the feet from the Fire. ) It was recorded by Al-Bayhaqi and Al-Hakim, and this chain is Sahih. Muslim recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that a man once performed Wudu' and left a dry spot the size of a fingernail on his foot. The Prophet saw that and he said to him,</p><p>«ارْجِعْ فَأَحْسِنْ وُضُوءَك»</p><p>(Go back and perform proper Wudu'.) Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi also recorded that Anas bin Malik said that a man came to the Prophet , after he performed Wudu' and left a dry spot the size of a fingernail on his foot. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«ارْجِعْ فَأَحْسِنْ وُضُوءَك»</p><p>(Go back and perform proper Wudu'.) Imam Ahmad recorded that some of the wives of the Prophet said that the Prophet saw a man praying, but noticed a dry spot on his foot, the size of a Dirham. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered that man to perform Wudu' again. This Hadith was also collected by Abu Dawud from Baqiyyah, who added in his narration, ""And (the Prophet ordered him) to repeat the prayer."" This Hadith has a strong, reasonably good chain of narrators. Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Necessity of Washing Between the Fingers</h2><p>n the Hadith that Humran narrated, `Uthman washed between his fingers when he was describing the Wudu' of the Prophet . The collectors of the Sunan recorded that Laqit bin Sabrah said, ""I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Tell me about Wudu'.' The Messenger ﷺ replied,</p><p>«أَسْبِغِ الْوُضُوءَ، وَخَلِّلْ بَيْنَ الْأَصَابِعِ، وَبَالِغْ فِي الِاسْتِنْشَاقِ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ صَائِمًا»</p><p>(Perform Wudu' thoroughly, wash between the fingers and exaggerate in rinsing your nose, unless you are fasting.)""</p><h2>Wiping Over the Khuffs is an Established Sunnah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Aws bin Abi Aws said, ""I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ perform Wudu' and wipe over his Khuffs. He then stood up for prayer."" Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith by Aws bin Abi Aws, who said in this narration, ""I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, after he answered the call of nature, perform Wudu' and wipe over his Khuffs and feet."" Imam Ahmad recorded that Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali said, ""I embraced Islam after Surat Al-Ma'idah was revealed and I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wipe after I became Muslim."" It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Hammam said, ""Jarir answered the call of nature and then performed Wudu' and wiped over his Khuffs. He was asked, `Do you do this' He said, `Yes. I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, after he answered the call of nature, perform Wudu' and wipe on his Khuffs.""' Al-A`mash commented that Ibrahim said, ""They liked this Hadith because Jarir embraced Islam after Surat Al-Ma'idah was revealed."" This is the wording collected by Muslim. The subject of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wiping over his Khuffs, instead of washing the feet, if he had worn his Khuffs while having Wudu', reaches the Mutawatir grade of narration, and they describe this practice by his words and actions.</p><h2>Performing Tayammum with Clean earth When There is no Water and When One is Ill</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَى أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَآءَ أَحَدٌ مِّنْكُم مِّنَ الْغَائِطِ أَوْ لَـمَسْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَآءً فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيداً طَيِّباً فَامْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ مِّنْهُ</p><p>(But if you are ill or on a journey or any of you comes from the Gha'it (toilet), or you have touched women and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands.) We discussed all of this in Surat An-Nisa', and thus we do not need to repeat it here. We also mentioned the reason behind revealing this Ayah. Yet, Al-Bukhari mentioned an honorable Hadith here specifically about the Tafsir of this noble Ayah. He recorded that `A'ishah said, ""Upon returning to Al-Madinah, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost) in Al-Bayda' area. Allah's Messenger ﷺ stayed there and went to sleep with his head on my lap. Abu Bakr (`A'ishah's father) came and hit me on my flank with his hand saying, `You have detained the people because of a necklace' So I wished I were dead because (I could not move) the Messenger ﷺ was sleeping on my lap and because of the pain Abu Bakr caused me. Allah's Messenger ﷺ got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلوةِ فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ</p><p>(O you who believe! When you stand (intend) to offer As-Salah (the prayer), then wash your faces) iuntil the end of the Ayah. Usayd bin Al-Hudayr said, `O the family of Abu Bakr! Allah has blessed the people because of you. Therefore, you are only a blessing for the people."" Allah said,</p><p>مَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(Allah does not want to place you in difficulty,) This is why He made things easy and lenient for you. This is why He allowed you to use Tayammum when you are ill and when you do not find water, to make things comfortable for you and as mercy for you. Allah made Tayammum in place of Wudu', and Allah made it the same as ablution with water for the one who it is legitimate for, except for certain things, as we mentioned before. For example; Tayammum only involves one strike with the hand on the sand and wiping the face and hands. Allah said,</p><p>وَلَـكِن يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهِّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</p><p>(but He wants to purify you, and to complete His favor on you that you may be thankful.) for His bounties on you, such as His easy, kind, merciful, comfortable and lenient legislation.</p><h2>Supplicating to Allah after Wudu</h2><p>The Sunnah encourages supplicating to Allah after Wudu' and states that those who do so are among those who seek to purify themselves, as the Ayah above states. Imam Ahmad, Muslim and the collectors of Sunan narrated that `Uqbah bin `Amir said, ""We were on watch, guarding camels, and when my turn to guard came, I took the camels back at night. I found that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was giving a speech to the people. I heard these words from that speech:</p><p>«مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُحْسِنُ وُضُوءهُ، ثُمَّ يَقُومُ فَيُصَلِّي رَكْعَتَيْنِ مُقْبلًا عَلَيْهِمَا بِقَلْبِهِ وَوَجْهِهِ، إِلَّا وَجَبَتْ لَهُ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Any Muslim who performs Wudu' properly, then stands up and prays a two Rak'ah prayer with full attention in his heart and face, will earn Paradise.) I said, `What a good statement this is!' A person who was close by said, `The statement he said before it is even better.' When I looked, I found that it was `Umar, who said, `I saw that you just came. The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُبْلِغُ أَوْفَيُسْبِغُ الْوُضُوءَ، يَقُولُ: أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، إِلَّا فُتِحَتْ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَةِ، يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاء»</p><p>(When any of you performs Wudu' properly and says, `I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger', the eight doors of Paradise will be opened for him so that he can enter from any door he wishes.)"" This is the wording collected by Muslim.</p><h2>The Virtue of Wudu</h2><p>Malik recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا تَوَضَّأَ الْعَبْدُ الْمُسْلِمُ أَوِ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَغَسَلَ وَجْهَهُ، خَرَجَ مِنْ وَجْهِهِ، كُلُّ خَطِيئَةٍ نَظَرَ إِلَيْهَا بِعَيْنَيْهِ مَعَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مَعَ آخِرِ قَطْرِ الْمَاءِ، فَإِذَا غَسَلَ يَدَيهِ خَرَجَ مِنْ يَدَيْهِ كُلُّ خَطِيئَةٍ بَطَشَتْهَا يَدَاهُ مَعَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مَعَ آخِرِ قَطْرِ الْمَاءِ، فَإِذَا غَسَلَ رِجْلَيْهِ خَرَجَتْ كُلُّ خَطِيئةٍ مَشَتْهَا رِجْلَاهُ مَعَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مَعَ آخِرِ قَطْرِ الْمَاءِ، حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ نَقِيًّا مِنَ الذُّنُوب»</p><p>(When the Muslim or the believing servant performs Wudu' and washes his face, every sin that he looked at with his eyes will depart from his face with the water, or with the last drop of water. When he washes his hands, every sin that his hands committed will depart from his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water. When he washes his feet, every sin to which his feet took him will depart with the water, or with the last drop of water. Until, he ends up sinless.) Muslim also recorded it. Muslim recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الطُّهُور شَطْرُ الْإِيمَانِ، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ تَمْلَأُ الْمِيزَانَ، وَسُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ تَمْلَأُ مَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، وَالصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ، وَالصَّبْرُ ضِيَاءٌ، وَالصدَقَةُ بُرْهَانٌ، وَالقُرْآنُ حُجَّةٌ لَكَ أَوْ عَلَيْكَ، كُلُّ النَّاسِ يَغْدُو، فَبَائِعٌ نَفْسَهُ فَمُعْتِقُهَا أَوْ مُوبِقُهَا»</p><p>(Purity is half of faith and Al-Hamdu Lillah (all the thanks are due to Allah) fills the Mizan (the Scale). And Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar (all praise is due to Allah, and Allah is the Most Great) fills what is between the heaven and earth. As-Sawm (the fast) is a Junnah (a shield), Sabr (patience) is a light, Sadaqah (charity) is evidence (of faith) and the Qur'an is proof for, or against you. Every person goes out in the morning and ends up selling himself, he either frees his soul or destroys it.) Muslim recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا يَقْبَلُ اللهُ صَدَقَةً مِنْ غُلُولٍ، وَلَا صَلَاةً بِغَيْرِ طُهُور»</p><p>(Allah does not accept charity from one who commits Ghulul, or prayer without purity.)</p>"
676,"<h2>Reminding the Believers of the Bounty of the Message and Islam</h2><p>Allah reminds His believing servants of His bounty by legislating this glorious religion and sending them this honorable Messenger. He also reminds them of the covenant and pledges that He took from them to follow the Messenger , support and aid him, implement his Law and convey it on his behalf, while accepting it themselves. Allah said,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَـقَهُ الَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor upon you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said, ""We hear and we obey."") This is the pledge that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when they embraced Islam. They used to say, ""We gave our pledge of obedience to the Messenger of Allah to hear and obey, in times when we are active and otherwise, even if we were passed on for rights, and not to dispute leadership with its rightful people."" Allah also said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَـقَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord; and He has indeed taken your covenant, if you are real believers.) It was also said that this Ayah (5:7) reminds the Jews of the pledges and promises Allah took from them to follow Muhammad and adhere to his Law, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas stated. Allah then said,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa of Allah.) in all times and situations. Allah says that He knows the secrets and thoughts that the hearts conceal,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is All-Knower of the secrets of (your) breasts.)</p><h2>The Necessity of Observing Justice</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَآ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ للَّهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah...) meaning, in truth for the sake of Allah, not for the sake of people or for fame,</p><p>شُهَدَآءَ بِالْقِسْطِ</p><p>(as just witnesses) observing justice and not transgression. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that An-Nu`man bin Bashir said, ""My father gave me a gift, but `Amrah bint Rawahah, my mother, said that she would not agree to it unless he made Allah's Messenger ﷺ as a witness to it. So, my father went to Allah's Messenger ﷺ to ask him to be a witness to his giving me the gift. Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked,</p><p>«أكل ولدك نحلت مثله؟»</p><p>(`Have you given the like of it to everyone of your offspring') He replied in the negative. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«اتَّقُوا اللهَ وَاعْدِلُوا فِي أَوْلَادِكُم»</p><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah and treat your children equally.) And said;</p><p>«إِنِّي لَا أَشْهَدُ عَلى جَوْر»</p><p>(I shall not be witness to injustice.) My father then returned and took back his gift."" Allah said;</p><p>وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ</p><p>(and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. ) The Ayah commands: Do not be carried away by your hatred for some people to avoid observing justice with them. Rather, be just with every one, whether a friend or an enemy. This is why Allah said,</p><p>اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p><p>(Be just: that is nearer to Taqwa) this is better than if you abandon justice in this case. Although Allah said that observing justice is `nearer to Taqwa', there is not any other course of action to take, therefore `nearer' here means `is'. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairer of places for repose.) Some of the female Companions said to `Umar, ""You are more rough and crude than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ,"" meaning, you are rough, not that the Prophet is rough at all. Allah said next,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(and have Taqwa of Allah. Verily, Allah is WellAcquainted with what you do.) and consequently, He will reward or punish you according to your actions, whether good or evil. Hence Allah's statement afterwards,</p><p>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ</p><p>(Allah has promised those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness) for their sins,</p><p>وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(and a great reward.) which is Paradise, that is part of Allah's mercy for His servants. They will not earn Paradise on account of their good actions, but rather on account of His mercy and favor, even though they will qualify to earn this mercy on account of their good actions. Allah has made these actions the cause and path that lead to His mercy, favor, pardon and acceptance. Therefore, all this is from Allah Alone and all thanks are due to Him. Allah said next,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَآ أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَحِيمِ</p><p>(And they who disbelieve and deny our Ayat are those who will be the dwellers of the Hell-fire.) This only demonstrates Allah's perfect justice, wisdom and judgment, He is never wrong, for He is the Most Wise, Most Just and Most Able.</p><h2>Among Allah's Favors is that He Prevented the Disbelievers from Fighting the Muslims</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَآ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ هَمَّ قَوْمٌ أَن يَبْسُطُواْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ</p><p>(O you who believe! Remember the favor of Allah unto you when some people desired (made a plan) to stretch out their hands against you, but (Allah) withheld their hands from you.) `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Jabir said, ""The Prophet once stayed at an area and the people spread out seeking shade under various trees. The Prophet hung his weapon on a tree, and a bedouin man came and took possession of the Prophet's weapon and held it aloft. He came towards the Prophet and said, `Who can protect you from me' He replied, `Allah, the Exalted, Most Honored.' The bedouin man repeated his question twice or thrice, each time the Prophet answering him by saying, `Allah.' The bedouin man then lowered the sword, and the Prophet called his Companions and told them what had happened while the bedouin was sitting next to him, for the Prophet did not punish him.' Ma`mar said that Qatadah used to mention that some Arabs wanted to have the Prophet killed, so they sent that bedouin. Qatadah would then mention this Ayah,</p><p>اذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ هَمَّ قَوْمٌ أَن يَبْسُطُواْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ</p><p>(Remember the favor of Allah unto you when some people desired (made a plan) to stretch out their hands against you...) The story of this bedouin man, whose name is Ghawrath bin Al-Harith, is mentioned in the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar, Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Bani An-Nadir, who plotted to drop a stone on the head of the Messenger when he came to them for help to pay the blood money of two persons whom Muslims killed. The Jews left the execution of this plot to `Amr bin Jihash bin Ka`b and ordered him to throw a stone on the Prophet from above, when he came to them and sat under the wall. Allah told His Prophet about their plot, and he went back to Al-Madinah and his Companions followed him later on. Allah sent down this Ayah concerning this matter. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) and those who do so, then Allah shall suffice for them and shall protect them from the evil plots of the people. Thereafter, Allah commanded His Messenger to expel Bani An-Nadir, and he laid siege to their area and forced them to evacuate Al-Madinah.</p>"

In this Ayah, Allah describes darkness in the plural, Zulumat where Zulmah is singular for darkness, while describing the light in the singular, An-Nur, because An-Nur is more honored. In other Ayat, Allah said, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ظِلَـلُهُ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ</div><p>(To the right and to the lefts.) 16:48 Near the end of this Surah (chapter 6), Allah also said; </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَنَّ هَـذَا صِرَطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</div><p>(And verily, this is my straight path, so follow it, and follow no (other) ways, for they will separate you away from His way.) 6:153 Allah said next, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثْمَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</div><p>(Yet those who disbelieve hold others as equal with their Lord.) meaning, in spite of all this, some of Allah's servants disbelieve in Him and hold others as partners and rivals with Him. Some of Allah's servants claimed a wife and a son for Allah, hallowed be He far above what they attribute to Him. Allah's statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">هُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن طِينٍ</div><p>(He it is Who has created you from clay,) refers to the father of mankind, Adam, from whom mankind originated, multiplied in numbers and spread about, east and west.

They will not contemplate about these Ayat or care about them. Allah said, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ بِالْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِيهِمْ أَنْبَاءُ مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, they rejected the truth when it came to them, but there will come to them the news of that which they used to mock at.) This Ayah contains a warning and a stern threat for the disbelievers' rejection of the truth, stating that the disbelievers will surely know the truth of what they used to deny and taste the evil end of their behavior. Allah advises and warns the disbelievers, that they should avoid the torments and afflictions of this life, similar to what befell their likes from previous nations, who were stronger, wealthier, had more offspring, and were more exploitive on the earth. Allah said, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن قَرْنٍ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَا لَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّكُمْ</div><p>(Have they not seen how many a generation before them We have destroyed whom We had established on the earth such as We have not established you) meaning, they had more wealth, children, buildings, abundant provision, riches and soldiers.

Consequently, even if the angels descend, while the disbelievers still had the same attitude, then the torment will surely befall them from Allah as a consequence. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُواْ إِذًا مُّنظَرِينَ </div><p>(We send not the angels down except with the truth (i.e. for torment, etc.), and in that case, they (the disbelievers) would have no respite!) 15:8, and, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels, no glad tidings will there be for the criminals that day.) 25:22 Allah's statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَـهُ مَلَكاً لَّجَعَلْنَـهُ رَجُلاً وَلَلَبَسْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّا يَلْبِسُونَ </div><p>(And had We appointed him an angel, We indeed would have made him a man, and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.) meaning, if We send an angel along with the human Messenger, or if We send an angel as a Messenger to mankind, he would be in the shape of a man so that they would be able to speak to him and benefit from his teachings. In this case, the angel (in the shape of a human) will also cause confusion for them, just as the confusion they caused themselves over accepting humans as Messengers! Allah said, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُل لَوْ كَانَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَلَـئِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ مَلَكًا رَّسُولاً </div><p>(Say: ""If there were on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger."") 17:95 It is a mercy from Allah to His creation that He sends every type of creation, Messengers from among their kind, so that they are able to call their people to Allah, and their people able to talk to them, ask them and benefit from them. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَقَدْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَى الْمُؤمِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ</div><p>(Indeed Allah conferred a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His verses (the Qur'an), and purifying them.) 3:164 Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah 6:9 above, ""If an angel was sent to them, he would come in the shape of a man. This is because they will not be able to look at the angel due to light."" </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَلَبَسْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّا يَلْبِسُونَ</div><p>(... and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion. ) meaning, We would confuse them over their confusion. And Al-Walibi reported Ibn `Abbas saying; ""We brought doubts around them."" Allah's statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَقَدِ اسْتُهْزِىءَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِالَّذِينَ سَخِرُواْ مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And indeed Messengers were mocked before you, but their scoffers were surrounded by the very thing that they used to mock at.) comforts the Messenger concerning the denial of him by his people. The Ayah also promises the Messenger , and his believers, of Allah's victory and the good end in this life and the Hereafter. Allah said next, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُلْ سِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ ثُمَّ انْظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(Say: ""Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who rejected truth."") meaning, contemplate about yourselves and think about the afflictions Allah struck the previous nations with, those who defied His Messengers and denied them. Allah sent torment, afflictions and punishment on them in this life, as well as the painful torment in the Hereafter, while saving His Messengers and believing servants. </p>"

Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَزِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَى بِنَا حَـسِبِينَ</p><p>(And We shall set up the Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And Sufficient are We to take account.)21:47,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Surely, Allah wrongs not even the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.) 4:40,</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَزِينُهُ فَهُوَ فِى عِيشَةٍ رَّاضِيَةٍ وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَزِينُهُ فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا هِيَهْ نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ</p><p>(Then as for him whose scale (of good deeds) will be heavy. He will live a pleasant life (in Paradise). But as for him whose scale (of good deeds) will be light. He will have his home in Hawiyah (pit, Hell). And what will make you know what it is (It is) a fiercely blazing Fire!) 101:6-11 and,</p><p>فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَزِينُهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ - وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَزِينُهُ فأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فِى جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another. Then, those whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose scales (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose themselves, in Hell will they abide)23:101-103. As for what will be placed on the Balance on the Day of Resurrection, it has been said that the deeds will be placed on it, even though they are not material objects. Allah will give these deeds physical weight on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Baghawi said that this was reported from Ibn `Abbas. It is recorded in the Sahih that Al-Baqarah (chapter 2) and Al `Imran (chapter 3) will come on the Day of Resurrection in the shape of two clouds, or two objects that provide shade, or two lined groups of birds. It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Qur'an will come to its companion (who used to recite and preserve it) in the shape of a pale-faced young man. He will ask (the young man), ""Who are you"" He will reply, ""I am the Qur'an, who made you stay up sleeplessly at night and caused you thirst in the day. "" The Hadith that Al-Bara' narrated about the questioning in the grave states,</p><p>«فَيَأْتِي الْمُؤْمِنَ شَابٌّ حَسَنُ اللَّوْنِ طَيِّبُ الرِّيحِ فَيَقُولُ: مَنْ أَنْتَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: أَنَا عَمَلُكَ الصَّالِح»</p><p>(A young man with fair color and good scent will come to the believer, who will ask, `Who are you' He will reply, `I am your good deeds'). The Prophet mentioned the opposite in the case of the disbeliever and the hypocrite. It was also said that the Book of Records that contains the deeds will be weighed. A Hadith states that a man will be brought forth and ninety-nine scrolls containing errors and sins will be placed on one side of the balance each as long as the sight can reach. He will then be brought a card on which `La ilaha illallah' will be written. He will say, ""O Lord! What would this card weigh against these scrolls"" Allah will say, ""You will not be wronged."" So the card will be placed on the other side of the Balance, and as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَطَاشَتِ السِّجِلَّاتُ وَثَقُلَتِ الْبِطَاقَة»</p><p>(Behold! The (ninety-nine) scrolls will go up, as the card becomes heavier.) At-Tirmidhi recorded similar wording for this Hadith and said that it is authentic. It was also said that the person who performed the deed will be weighed. A Hadith states,</p><p>«يُؤْتَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِالرَّجُلِ السَّمِينِ فَلَا يَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَة»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, a fat man will be brought forth, but he will not weigh with Allah equal to the wing of a mosquito). He then recited the Ayah,</p><p>فَلاَ نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَزْناً</p><p>(And on the Day of Resurrection, We shall assign no weight for them) 18:105. Also, the Prophet said about `Abdullah bin Mas`ud,</p><p>«أَتَعْجَبُونَ مِنْ دِقَّةِ سَاقَيْهِ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَهُمَا فِي الْمِيزَانِ أَثْقَلُ مِنْ أُحُد»</p><p>(Do you wonder at the thinness of his legs By He in Whose Hand is my soul! They are heavier on the Balance than (Mount) Uhud.) It is also possible to combine the meanings of these Ayat and Hadiths by stating that all this will truly occur, for sometimes the deeds will be weighed, sometimes the scrolls where they are recorded will be weighed, and sometimes those who performed the deeds will be weighed. Allah knows best.</p>"

Similar was said by Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Muqatil bin Hayyan, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and several others. It was also said that the Nafl (singular for Anfal) refers to the portion of the spoils of war that the commander gives to some of the fighters after dividing the bulk of the spoils. It was also said that Anfal refers to the Khumus; one-fifth of the captured goods after four-fifths are divided between the fighters. It was also said that the Anfal refers to the Fay', the possessions taken from the disbelievers without fighting, and the animals, servants or whatever other possessions escape from the disbelievers to Muslims.</p><p>Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ali bin Salih bin Hay said: ""It has reached me that,</p><p>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الأَنفَالِ</p><p>(They ask you about Al-Anfal) is about the divisions. This refer to what the Imam gives to some squads in addition to what is divided among the rest of the soldiers.""</p><h2>The Reason behind revealing Ayah 8:1</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`d bin Malik said, ""I said, `O Allah's Messenger, Allah has brought comfort to me today over the idolators, so grant me this sword.' He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ هَذَا السَّيْفَ لَا لَكَ وَلَا لِي، ضَعْه»</p><p>(This sword is neither yours nor mine; put it down.) So I put it down, but said to myself, `The Prophet might give this sword to another man who did not fight as fiercely as I did.'

However, it has been granted to me (by Allah), and I give it to you.) So Allah sent down this Ayah,</p><p>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الأَنفَالِ قُلِ الأَنفَالُ لِلَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ</p><p>(They ask you about Al-Anfal.

So Allah took Al-Anfal from us and gave it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Messenger ﷺ divided it equally among Muslims.""'</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, ""We went with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to the battle of Badr. When the two armies met, Allah defeated the enemy and some of us pursued them inflicting utter defeat and casualties. Another group of us came to the battlefield collecting the spoils of war. Another group surrounded the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so that the enemy could not attack him suddenly. When it was night and the various army groups went back to our camp, some of those who collected the spoils said, `We collected it, so none else will have a share in it.' Those who went in pursuit of the enemy said, `No, you have no more right to it than us. We kept the enemy away from the war spoils and defeated them.' Those who surrounded the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to protect him said, `You have no more right to it than us, we surrounded the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for fear that the enemy might conduct a surprise attack against him, so we were busy.' The Ayah,</p><p>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الأَنفَالِ قُلِ الأَنفَالُ لِلَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَصْلِحُواْ ذَاتَ بِيْنِكُمْ</p><p>(They ask you about Al-Anfal (the spoils of war). Say: ""Al-Anfal are for Allah and the Messenger."" So fear Allah and settle all matters of difference among you.) was revealed and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ divided the Anfal equally between Muslims.""'</p><p>«وَكَانَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلّم إِذَا أَغَارَ فِي أَرْضِ الْعَدُوِّ نَفَلَ الرُّبُعَ، فَإِذَا أَقْبَلَ وَكُلّ النَّاسِ رَاجِعًا نَفَلَ الثُّلُث»</p><p>(And Allah's Messenger would give a fourth for Anfal when there was a surprise attack in the land of the enemy, and when there was a confrontation then a third to the people who returned).</p><p>The Prophet used to dislike the Anfal and encouraged strong fighters to give some of their share to weak Muslim fighters. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected a similar narration for this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan"".</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَصْلِحُواْ ذَاتَ بِيْنِكُمْ</p><p>(So have Taqwa of Allah and settle all matters of difference among you,)</p><p>The Ayah commands, have Taqwa of Allah in all your affairs, settle matters of differences between you, do not wrong each other, do not dispute, and do not differ. Certainly, the guidance and knowledge that Allah has granted you is better than what you are disputing about such as Al-Anfal,</p><p>وَأَطِيعُواْ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ</p><p>(and obey Allah and His Messenger,) in the division that the Messenger makes according to Allah's order. The Prophet only divided according to what Allah ordained, which is perfectly just and fair. Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, ""This is a command from Allah and His Messenger to the believers, that they should have Taqwa of Allah and settle all matters of differences between them."" A similar statement was reported from Mujahid. As-Suddi also commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَصْلِحُواْ ذَاتَ بِيْنِكُمْ</p><p>(So have Taqwa of Allah and settle all matters of difference among you), meaning ""Do not curse each other.""</p>"
1162,"<h2>Qualities of the Faithful and Truthful Believers</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</p><p>(The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts)</p><p>""None of Allah's remembrance enters the hearts of the hypocrites upon performing what He has ordained. They neither believe in any of Allah's Ayat nor trust (in Allah) nor pray if they are alone nor pay the Zakah due on their wealth. Allah stated that they are not believers. He then described the believers by saying,</p><p>إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</p><p>(The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts) and they perform what He has ordained,</p><p>وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً</p><p>(and when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith) and conviction,</p><p>وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</p><p>(and they put their trust in their Lord), having hope in none except Him. "" Mujahid commented on,</p><p>وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</p><p>(their hearts Wajilat), ""Their hearts become afraid and fearful."" Similar was said by As-Suddi and several others. The quality of a true believer is that when Allah is mentioned, he feels a fear in his heart, and thus implements His orders and abstains from His prohibitions. Allah said in a similar Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُواْ فَـحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُواْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُواْ لِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَن يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَلَمْ يُصِرُّواْ عَلَى مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (immoral sin) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; -- and none can forgive sins but Allah -- and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know) 3:135, and,</p><p>وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَى - فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from vain desires. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.) 79:40-41</p><p>Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated that As-Suddi commented,</p><p>إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</p><h2>(The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts)</h2><p>""A man might be thinking of committing injustice or a sin. But he abstains when he is told, `Have Taqwa of Allah', and his heart becomes fearful.""'</p><h2>Faith increases when the Qur'an is recited</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً</p><p>(And when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith;) is similar to His statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ</p><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them (hypocrites) say: ""Which of you has had his faith increased by it"" As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice) 9:124.</p><p>Al-Bukhari and other scholars relied on this Ayah (8:2) and those similar, as evidence that faith increases and varies in strength from heart to heart. This is also the view of the majority of the scholars of Islam, prompting some scholars, such as Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Abu `Ubayd to declare that this is the consensus of the Ummah, as we mentioned in the beginning of the explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah.</p><h2>The Reality of Tawakkul</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</p><p>(And they put their trust in their Lord.)</p><p>Therefore, the believers hope in none except Allah, direct their dedication to Him alone, seek refuge with Him alone, invoke Him alone for their various needs and supplicate to Him alone. They know that whatever He wills, occurs and that whatever He does not will never occurs, that He alone is the One Who has the decision in His kingdom, without partners; none can avert the decision of Allah and He is swift in reckoning. Hence the statement of Sa`id bin Jubayr, ""Tawakkul of Allah is the essence of faith.</p><h2>Deeds of Faithful Believers</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَوةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(Who perform the Salah and spend out of what We have provided them.)</p><p>Allah describes the actions of the believers after He mentioned their faith. The acts mentioned here include all types of righteous acts, such as establishing prayer, which is Allah's right. Qatadah said, ""Establishing the prayer requires preserving its times, making ablution for it, bowing down and prostrating."" Muqatil bin Hayyan said, ""Establishing the prayer means to preserve its times, perform perfect purity for it, perform perfect bowings and prostrations, recite the Qur'an during it, sitting for Tashahhud and reciting the Salah (invoking Allah's blessings) for the benefit of the Prophet.""</p><p>Spending from what Allah has granted includes giving the Zakah and the rest of the what is due from the servant, either what is obligatory or recommended. All of the servants are Allah's dependents, and the most beloved among them to Him are the most beneficial to His creation.</p><h2>The Reality of Faith</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>أُوْلـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ حَقّاً</p><p>(It is they who are the believers in truth.) means, those who have these qualities are the believers with true faith.</p><h2>The Fruits of Perfect Faith</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لَّهُمْ دَرَجَـتٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(For them are grades of dignity with their Lord) meaning, they have different grades, ranks and status in Paradise,</p><p>هُمْ دَرَجَـتٌ عِندَ اللَّهِ واللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(They are in varying grades with Allah, and Allah is All-Seer of what they do.)3:163</p><p>Next, Allah said,</p><p>وَمَغْفِرَةٌ</p><p>(and forgiveness), therefore, Allah will forgive them their sins and reward them for their good deeds. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَهْلَ عِلِّيِّينَ لَيَرَاهُمْ مَنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الْغَابِرَ فِي أُفُقٍ مِنْ آفَاقِ السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The residents of `Illiyyin (in Paradise) are seen from those below them, just as you see the distant planet in the horizon of the sky.)</p><p>They said, ""O Allah's Messenger! They are the grades of the Prophets that none except them would attain."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«بَلَى وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لِرِجَالٌ آمَنُوا بِاللهِ وَصَدَّقُوا الْمُرْسَلِين»</p><p>(Rather, by He in Whose Hand is my soul! They are for men who have faith in Allah and believed in the Messengers.)</p><p>In a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan, Abu `Atiyyah said that Ibn Abu Sa`id said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ لَيَتَرَاءَونَ أَهْلَ الدَّرَجَاتِ الْعُلَى كَمَا تَرَاءَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الْغَابِرَ فِي أُفُقِ السَّمَاءِ وَإِنَّ أَبَا بَكْرٍ وَعُمَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَنْعَمَا»</p><p>(Residents of Paradise see the residents of the highest grades just as you see the distant planet in the horizon of the sky. Verily, Abu Bakr and `Umar are among them (in the highest grades), and how excellent they are.)</p>"

1165,"<h2>Following the Messenger is Better for the Believers</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>كَمَآ أَخْرَجَكَ رَبُّكَ</p><p>(As your Lord caused you to go out...) After Allah described the believers as fearing their Lord, resolving matters of dispute between themselves and obeying Allah and His Messenger , He then said here, ""since you disputed about dividing war spoils and differed with each other about them, Allah took them away from you. He and His Messenger then divided them in truth and justice, thus ensuring continued benefit for all of you. Similarly, you disliked meeting the armed enemy in battle, who marched in support of their religion and to protect their caravan. You disliked fighting, so Allah decided that battle should occur and made you meet your enemy, without planning to do so on your part.' This incident carried guidance, light, victory and triumph. Allah said;</p><p>كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَى أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(Jihad is ordained for you though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you.

Abu Sufyan was cautiously gathering information on the latest news spying on travelers he met, out of fear for the caravan, especially upon entering the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Some travelers told him that Muhammad ﷺ had mobilized his companions for his caravan. He was anxious and hired Damdam bin `Amr Al-Ghifari to go to Makkah and mobilize the Quraysh to protect their caravan, informing them that Muhammad ﷺ had mobilized his Companions to intercept the caravan. Damdam bin `Amr went in a hurry to Makkah. Meanwhile, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ marched with his companions until he reached a valley called Dhafiran. When he left the valley, he camped and was informed that the Quraysh had marched to protect their caravan. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ consulted the people for advice and conveyed the news about Quraysh to them. Abu Bakr stood up and said something good, and so did `Umar. Al-Miqdad bin `Amr stood up and said, `O Allah's Messenger! March to what Allah has commanded you, for we are with you. By Allah! We will not say to you what the Children of Israel said to Musa,</p><p>فَاذْهَبْ أَنتَ وَرَبُّكَ فَقَاتِلا إِنَّا هَـهُنَا قَـعِدُونَ</p><p>(""So go you and your Lord and fight you two, we are sitting right here"") 5:24. Rather, go you and Your Lord and fight, we will be fighting along with you both. By He Who has sent you with Truth! If you decide to take us to Birk-ul-Ghimad, we will fight along with you until you reach it.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said good words to Al-Miqdad and invoked Allah for his benefit. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ again said,</p><p>«أَشِيرُوا عَلَيَّ أَيُّهَا النَّاس»</p><p>(Give me your opinion, O people! wanting to hear from the Ansar. This is because the majority of the people with him then were the Ansar. When the Ansar gave the Prophet their pledge of obedience at Al-`Aqabah, they proclaimed, `O Allah's Messenger! We are not bound by this pledge unless, and until, you arrive in our land. When you have arrived in our area, you are under our protection, and we shall protect you in the same manner we protect our children and wives.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ feared that the Ansar might think that they are not obliged to support him except from his enemies who attack Al-Madinah, not to march with him to an enemy in other areas. When the Prophet said this, Sa`d bin Mu`adh asked him, `O Allah's Messenger! Is it us whom you meant' The Prophet answered in the positive. Sa`d said, `We have faith and believed in you, testified that what you brought is the truth, and gave you our pledges and promises of allegiance and obedience. Therefore, march, O Allah's Messenger, for what Allah has commanded you. Verily, by He Who has sent you in Truth, if you decided to cross this sea (the Red Sea), we will follow you in it, and none among us would stay behind. We do not dislike that we meet our enemy tomorrow. Verily, we are patient in war, fierce in battle. May Allah make you witness what makes your eyes pleased with us. Therefore, march with us with the blessing of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased with what Sa`d said and was encouraged by it. He proclaimed,</p><p>«سِيرُوا عَلَى بَرَكَةِ اللهِ وَأَبْشِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللهَ قَدْ وَعَدَنِي إِحْدَى الطَّائِفَتَيْنِ وَاللهِ لَكَأَنِّي الْآنَ أَنْظُرُ إِلَى مَصَارِعِ الْقَوم»</p><p>(March with the blessing of Allah and receive the good news.

1169,"<h2>Muslims invoke Allah for Help, Allah sends the Angels to help Them</h2><p>Al-Bukhari wrote in the book of battles (in his Sahih) under ""Chapter; Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَاسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ</p><p>((Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you) until,</p><p>فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p><p>(then verily, Allah is severe in punishment)"" that Ibn Mas`ud said, ""I was a witness to something that Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad did, that I would like more than almost anything else to have been the one who did it.

I saw the Prophet's face beaming with pleasure because of what Al-Miqdad said to him."" Al-Bukhari next narrated from Ibn `Abbas that on the day of Badr, the Prophet said,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ أَنْشُدُكَ عَهْدَكَ وَوَعْدَكَ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ شِئْتَ لَمْ تُعْبَد»</p><p>(O Allah! I invoke You for Your covenant and promise (victory). O Allah! If You decide so (cause our defeat), You will not be worshipped.)</p><p>Abu Bakr held the Prophet's hand and said, ""Enough."" The Prophet went out proclaiming,</p><p>«سَيُهْزَمُ الْجَمْعُ وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُر»</p><p>(Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.)</p><p>An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>بِأَلْفٍ مِّنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةِ مُرْدِفِينَ</p><p>(with a thousand of the angels Murdifin) means, they follow each other in succession, according to Harun bin Hubayrah who narrated this from Ibn `Abbas about,</p><p>مُرْدِفِينَ</p><p>(Murdifin), meaning each behind the other in succession. `Ali bin Abi Talhah Al-Walibi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Allah supported His Prophet and the believers with a thousand angels, five hundred under the leadership of Jibril on one side and five hundred under the leadership of Mika'il on another side."" Imams Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari and Muslim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that `Umar said, ""While a Muslim man was pursuing an idolator (during the battle of Badr), he heard the sound of a whip above him and a rider saying, `Come, O Hayzum!' Then he looked at the idolator, who fell to the ground. When he investigated, he found that the idolator's nose had wound and his face torn apart, just as if he received a strike from a whip on it, and the entire face had turned green. The Ansari man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and told him what had happened and the Messenger ﷺ replied,</p><p>«صَدَقْتَ، ذَلِكَ مِنْ مَدَدِ السَّمَاءِ الثَّالِثَة»</p><p>(You have said the truth, that was from the reinforcements from the third heaven.)</p><p>The Muslims killed seventy (pagans) in that battle and captured another seventy.</p><p>Al-Bukhari also wrote a chapter in his Sahih about the participation of the angels in Badr. He collected a Hadith from Rifa`h bin Rafi `Az-Zuraqi, who participated in Badr, Jibril came to the Prophet and asked him, ""How honored are those who participated in Badr among you"" The Prophet said,</p><p>«مِنْ أَفْضَلِ الْمُسْلِمِين»</p><p>(Among the best Muslims.) Jibril said, ""This is the case with the angels who participated in Badr."" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith. At-Tabarani also collected it in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir, but from Rafi` bin Khadij, which is an apparent mistake. The correct narration is from Rifa`h, as Al-Bukhari recorded it. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to `Umar, when `Umar suggested that the Prophet have Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah executed,</p><p>«إِنَّهُ قَدْ شَهِدَ بَدْرًا وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ اللهَ قَدِ اطَّلَعَ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَدْرٍ فَقَالَ: اعْمَلُوا مَا شِئْتُمْ فَقَدْ غَفَرْتُ لَكُم»</p><p>(He Hatib participated in Badr. How do you know that Allah has not looked at the people of Badr and proclaimed, `Do whatever you want, for I have forgiven you.')</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ بُشْرَى</p><p>(Allah made it only as glad tidings. ..)</p><p>Allah made sending down the angels and informing you of this fact as glad tidings,</p><p>وَلِتَطْمَئِنَّ بِهِ قُلُوبُكُمْ</p><p>(and that your hearts be at rest therewith.)</p><p>Surely, Allah is able to give you (O Muslims) victory over your enemies, and victory only comes from Him, without need to send the angels,</p><p>وَمَا النَّصْرُ إِلاَّ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And there is no victory except from Allah.)</p><p>Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ حَتَّى إِذَآ أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّواْ الْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لاَنْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ - سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ - وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ</p><p>(So, when you meet (in fight in Allah's cause) those who disbelieve, smite (their) necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, take them as captives).

Thus, but if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them.) 47:4-6</p><p>and,</p><p>إِن يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ الْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِّثْلُهُ وَتِلْكَ الاٌّيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ النَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنكُمْ شُهَدَآءَ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الظَّـلِمِينَ - وَلِيُمَحِّصَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَيَمْحَقَ الْكَـفِرِينَ</p><p>(And so are the days (good and not so good), that We give to men by turns, that Allah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allah likes not the wrongdoers. And that Allah may test (or purify) the believers (from sins) and destroy the disbelievers.) 3:140-141</p><p>These are points of wisdom for which Allah has legislated performing Jihad, by the hands of the believers against the disbelievers. Allah used to destroy the previous nations that denied the Prophets, using various disasters that encompassed these rebellious nations. For instance, Allah destroyed the people of Nuh with the flood, `Ad with the wind, Thamud with the scream, the people of Lut with an earthquake and the people of Shu`ayb by the Day of the Shadow. After Allah sent Musa and destroyed his enemy Fir`awn and his soldiers by drowning, He sent down the Tawrah to him in which He legislated fighting against the disbelievers, and this legislation remained in the successive Laws. Allah said,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا الْقُرُونَ الاٍّولَى بَصَآئِرَ</p><p>(And indeed We gave Musa -- after We had destroyed the generations of old -- the Scripture as an enlightenment. ) 28:43</p><p>It is more humiliating for the disbeliever and more comforting to the hearts of the faithful that the believers kill the disbelievers by their own hands. Allah said to the believers of this Ummah,</p><p>قَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people.)9:14</p><p>This is why killing the disbelievers of Quraysh by the hand of their enemies, whom they used to despise, was more humiliating to the disbelievers and comforting to the hearts of the party of faith. Abu Jahl, for instance, was killed in battle and this was more humiliating for him than dying in his bed, or from lightening, wind, or similar afflictions. Also, Abu Lahab died from a terrible disease that caused him to stink and none of his relatives could bear approaching him. They had to wash him with water by sprinkling it from a distance, then threw stones over his corpse, until it was buried under them! Allah said next,</p><p>أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is All-Mighty,), the might is His, His Messengers and the believers, both in this life and the Hereafter. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الاٌّشْهَـدُ</p><p>(We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe, in this world's life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth (Day of Resurrection). )40:51</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(All-Wise.), in that He legislated fighting the disbeliever, even though He is able to destroy them and bring their demise by His will and power, all praise and honor is due to Him.</p>"

1236,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>Why there is no Basmalah in the Beginning of This Surah</h2><p>This honorable Surah (chapter 9) was one of the last Surahs to be revealed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, ""The last Ayah to be revealed was,</p><p>يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ اللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِى الْكَلَـلَةِ</p><p>(They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: ""Allah directs (thus) about Al-Kalalah."") 4:176, while the last Surah to be revealed was Bara'ah.""</p><p>The Basmalah was not mentioned in the beginning of this Surah because the Companions did not write it in the complete copy of the Qur'an (Mushaf) they collected, following the Commander of the faithful, `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him. The first part of this honorable Surah was revealed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he returned from the battle of Tabuk, during the Hajj season, which the Prophet thought about attending. But he remembered that the idolators would still attend that Hajj, as was usual in past years, and that they perform Tawaf around the House while naked. He disliked to associate with them and sent Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, to lead Hajj that year and show the people their rituals, commanding him to inform the idolators that they would not be allowed to participate in Hajj after that season. He commanded him to proclaim,</p><p>بَرَآءَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(Freedom from (all) obligations (is declared) from Allah and His Messenger ()...), to the people. When Abu Bakr had left, the Messenger ﷺ sent `Ali bin Abu Talib to be the one to deliver this news to the idolators on behalf of the Messenger ﷺ, for he was the Messenger's cousin. We will mention this story later.</p><h2>Publicizing the Disavowal of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>بَرَآءَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(Freedom from obligations from Allah and His Messenger ()), is a declaration of freedom from all obligations from Allah and His Messenger ,</p><p>إِلَى الَّذِينَ عَاهَدْتُمْ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَفَسِيحُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ</p><p>(to those of the Mushrikin, with whom you made a treaty. So travel freely (Mushrikin) for four months (as you will) throughout the land) 9:1-2. This Ayah refers to idolators who had indefinite treaties and those, whose treaties with Muslims ended in less than four months. The terms of these treaties were restricted to four months only. As for those whose term of peace ended at a specific date later (than the four months), then their treaties would end when their terms ended, no matter how long afterwards, for Allah said,</p><p>فَأَتِمُّواْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَهْدَهُمْ إِلَى مُدَّتِهِمْ</p><p>(So fulfill their treaty for them until the end of their term)9:4. So whoever had a coventant with Allah's Messenger ﷺ then it would last until its period expired, this was reported from Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and others. We will also mention a Hadith on this matter. Abu Ma`shar Al-Madani said that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and several others said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Abu Bakr to lead the Hajj rituals on the ninth year (of Hijrah). He also sent `Ali bin Abi Talib with thirty or forty Ayat from Bara'ah (At-Tawbah), and he recited them to the people, giving the idolators four months during which they freely move about in the land. He recited these Ayat on the day of `Arafah (ninth of Dhul-Hijjah). The idolators were given twenty more days (till the end) of Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, Rabi` Al-Awwal and ten days from Rabi` Ath-Thani. He proclaimed to them in their camping areas, `No Mushrik will be allowed to perform Hajj after this year, nor a naked person to perform Tawaf around the House.""' So Allah said,</p>"
1237,
1238,"<h2>Allah says, this is a declaration,</h2><p>مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(from Allah and His Messenger), and a preface warning to the people,</p><p>يَوْمَ الْحَجِّ الاٌّكْبَرِ</p><p>(on the greatest day of Hajj), the day of Sacrifice, the best and most apparent day of the Hajj rituals, during which the largest gathering confers.</p><p>أَنَّ اللَّهَ بَرِىءٌ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَرَسُولُهُ</p><p>(that Allah is free from (all) obligations to the Mushrikin and so is His Messenger.) also free from all obligations to them. Allah next invites the idolators to repent,</p><p>فَإِن تُبْتُمْ</p><p>(So if you repent), from the misguidance and Shirk you indulge in,</p><p>فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ</p><p>(it is better for you, but if you turn away), and persist on your ways,</p><p>فَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِى اللَّهِ</p><p>(then know that you cannot escape Allah) Rather, Allah is capable over you, and you are all in His grasp, under His power and will,</p><p>وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(And give tidings of a painful torment for those who disbelieve) earning them disgrace and affliction in this life and the torment of chains and barbed iron bars in the Hereafter. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""Abu Bakr sent me during that Hajj with those dispatched on the day of Sacrifice to declare in Mina that no Mushrik will be allowed to attend Hajj after that year, nor will a naked person be allowed to perform Tawaf."" Humayd said, ""The Prophet then sent `Ali bin Abi Talib and commanded him to announce Bara'ah."" Abu Hurayrah said, ""Ali publicized Bara'ah with us to the gathering in Mina on the day of Sacrifice, declaring that no Mushrik shall perform Hajj after that year, nor shall a naked person perform Tawaf around the House."" Al-Bukhari also collected this Hadith the this narration of which, Abu Hurayrah said, ""On the day of Nahr, Abu Bakr sent me along with other announcers to Mina to make a public announcement that `No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this year, and no naked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`bah.' Abu Bakr was leading the people in that Hajj season, and in the year of `The Farewell Hajj' when the Prophet performed Hajj, no Mushrik performed Hajj.""' This is the narration that Al-Bukhari recorded in the Book on Jihad. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported a narration from Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali bin Al-Husayn who said, ""When Bara'ah was revealed to Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and he had sent Abu Bakr to oversee the Hajj rites for the people, he was asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Why not send this message to Abu Bakr' So he said,</p><p>«لَا يُؤَدِّي عَنِّي إِلَّا رَجُلٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ بَيْتِي»</p><p>(It will not be accepted to have been from me if it is not from a man from my family.) Then he called for `Ali and said to him,</p><p>«اخْرُجْ بِهذِهِ الْقِصَّةِ مِنْ صَدْرِ بَرَاءَةَ وَأَذِّنْ فِي النَّاسِ يَوْمَ النَّحْرِ إِذَا اجْتَمَعُوا بِمِنًى، أَنَّهُ لَا يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ كَافِرٌ، وَلَا يَحُجُّ بَعْدَ الْعَامِ مُشْرِكٌ، وَلَا يَطُوفُ بِالْبَيْتِ عُرْيَانٌ، وَمَنْ كَانَ لَهُ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلّم عَهْدٌ فَهُوَ لَهُ إِلَى مُدَّتِه»</p><p>(Take this section from the beginning of Bara'ah and proclaim to the people on the day of the Sacrifice while they are gathered at Mina that no disbeliever will enter Paradise, no idolator will be permitted to perform Hajj after the year, there will be no Tawaf while naked, and whoever has a covenant with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, then it shall be valid until the time of its expiration.) `Ali rode the camel of Allah's Messenger named Al-`Adba' until he caught up with Abu Bakr in route. When Abu Bakr saw him he said, `Are you here as a commander or a follower.' `Ali replied, `A follower.' They continued on. Abu Bakr lead the people in Hajj while the Arabs were camping in their normal locations from Jahiliyyah. On the day of Sacrifice, `Ali bin Abi Talib stood and proclaimed, `O people! No disbeliever will be admitted into Paradise, no idolator will be permitted to perform Hajj next year, there shall be no Tawaf while naked, and whoever has a covenant with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, then it shall be valid until its time of expiration.' So no idolator performed Hajj after that year, Tawaf around the House while naked ceased. Then they returned to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. So this was the declaration of innocence, whoever among the idolators had no treaty, then he had a treaty of peace for one year, if he had a particular treaty, then it was valid until its date of expiration.""</p>"
1239,"<h2>Existing Peace Treaties remained valid until the End of Their Term</h2><p>This is an exception regulating the longest extent of time for those who have a general treaty - with out time mentioned - to four months. They would have four months to travel the lands in search of sanctuary for themselves wherever they wish. Those whose treaty mentioned a specifec limited term, then the longest it would extend was to the point of its agreed upon termination date. Hadiths in this regard preceeded. So anyone who had a treaty with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, it lasted until its specific termination date. However, those in this category were required to refrain from breaking the terms of the agreement with Muslims and from helping non-Muslims against Muslims. This is the type whose peace agreement with Muslims was carried out to its end. Allah encouraged honoring such peace treaties, saying,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Surely, Allah loves those who have Taqwa) 9:4, who keep their promises.</p>"
1240,"<h2>This is the Ayah of the Sword</h2><p>Mujahid, `Amr bin Shu`ayb, Muhammad bin Ishaq, Qatadah, As-Suddi and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that the four months mentioned in this Ayah are the four-month grace period mentioned in the earlier Ayah,</p><p>فَسِيحُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ</p><p>(So travel freely for four months throughout the land.) Allah said next,</p><p>فَإِذَا انسَلَخَ الأَشْهُرُ الْحُرُمُ</p><p>(So when the Sacred Months have passed...), meaning, `Upon the end of the four months during which We prohibited you from fighting the idolators, and which is the grace period We gave them, then fight and kill the idolators wherever you may find them.' Allah's statement next,</p><p>فَاقْتُلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ</p><p>(then fight the Mushrikin wherever you find them), means, on the earth in general, except for the Sacred Area, for Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تُقَـتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ حَتَّى يُقَـتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَـتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ</p><p>(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram, unless they fight you there. But if they attack you, then fight them. )2:191 Allah said here,</p><p>وَخُذُوهُمْ</p><p>(and capture them), executing some and keeping some as prisoners,</p><p>وَاحْصُرُوهُمْ وَاقْعُدُواْ لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ</p><p>(and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush), do not wait until you find them. Rather, seek and besiege them in their areas and forts, gather intelligence about them in the various roads and fairways so that what is made wide looks ever smaller to them. This way, they will have no choice, but to die or embrace Islam,</p><p>فَإِن تَابُواْ وَأَقَامُواْ الصَّلَوةَ وَءاتَوُاْ الزَّكَوةَ فَخَلُّواْ سَبِيلَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(But if they repent and perform the Salah, and give the Zakah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Abu Bakr As-Siddiq used this and other honorable Ayat as proof for fighting those who refrained from paying the Zakah. These Ayat allowed fighting people unless, and until, they embrace Islam and implement its rulings and obligations. Allah mentioned the most important aspects of Islam here, including what is less important. Surely, the highest elements of Islam after the Two Testimonials, are the prayer, which is the right of Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, then the Zakah, which benefits the poor and needy. These are the most honorable acts that creatures perform, and this is why Allah often mentions the prayer and Zakah together. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَشْهَدُوا أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللهِ وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاة»</p><p>(I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah, establish the prayer and pay the Zakah.) This honorable Ayah (9:5) was called the Ayah of the Sword, about which Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, ""It abrogated every agreement of peace between the Prophet and any idolator, every treaty, and every term."" Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas commented: ""No idolator had any more treaty or promise of safety ever since Surah Bara'ah was revealed. The four months, in addition to, all peace treaties conducted before Bara'ah was revealed and announced had ended by the tenth of the month of Rabi` Al-Akhir.""</p>"
1241,"<h2>Idolators are granted Safe Passage if They seek It</h2><p>Allah said to His Prophet, peace be upon him,</p><p>وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p>(And if anyone of the Mushrikin), whom you were commanded to fight and We allowed you their blood and property,'</p><p>اسْتَجَارَكَ</p><p>(seeks your protection), asked you for safe passage, then accept his request until he hears the Words of Allah, the Qur'an. Recite the Qur'an to him and mention a good part of the religion with which you establish Allah's proof against him,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَبْلِغْهُ مَأْمَنَهُ</p><p>(and then escort him to where he can be secure) and safe, until he goes back to his land, his home, and area of safety,</p><p>ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(that is because they are men who know not.) The Ayah says, `We legislated giving such people safe passage so that they may learn about the religion of Allah, so that Allah's call will spread among His servants. Ibn Abi Najih narrated that Mujahid said that this Ayah, ""Refers to someone who comes to you to hear what you say and what was revealed to you (O Muhammad). Therefore, he is safe until he comes to you, hears Allah's Words and then proceeds to the safe area where he came from."" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to thereafter grant safe passage to those who came to him for guidance or to deliver a message. On the day of Hudaybiyyah, several emissaries from Quraysh came to him, such as `Urwah bin Mas`ud, Mikraz bin Hafs, Suhayl bin `Amr and several others. They came mediating between him and the Quraysh pagans. They witnessed the great respect the Muslims had for the Prophet , which astonished them, for they never before saw such respect for anyone, kings nor czars. They went back to their people and conveyed this news to them; this, among other reasons, was one reason that most of them accepted the guidance. When Musaylimah the Liar sent an emissary to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he asked him, ""Do you testify that Musaylimah is a messenger from Allah"" He said, ""Yes."" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْلَا أَنَّ الرُّسُلَ لَا تُقْتَلُ لَضَرَبْتُ عُنُقَك»</p><p>(I would have cut off your head, if it was not that emissaries are not killed.) That man, Ibn An-Nawwahah, was later beheaded when `Abdullah bin Mas`ud was the governor of Al-Kufah. When it became known that he still testified that Musaylimah was a messenger from Allah, Ibn Mas`ud summoned him and said to him, ""You are not delivering a message now!"" He commanded that Ibn An-Nawwahah be decapitated, may Allah curse him and deprive him of His mercy. In summary, those who come from a land at war with Muslims to the area of Islam, delivering a message, for business transactions, to negotiate a peace treaty, to pay the Jizyah, to offer an end to hostilities, and so forth, and request safe passage from Muslim leaders or their deputies, should be granted safe passage, as long as they remain in Muslim areas, until they go back to their land and sanctuary.</p>"
1242,"<h2>Affirming the Disavowel of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah mentions the wisdom in dissolving all obligations to the idolators and giving them a four month period of safety, after which they will meet the sharp sword wherever they are found,</p><p>كَيْفَ يَكُونُ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ عَهْدٌ</p><p>(How can there be a covenant for the Mushrikin), a safe resort and refuge, while they persist in Shirk with Allah, and disbelief in Him and His Messenger,</p><p>إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ عَـهَدْتُمْ عِندَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p>(except those with whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjid Al-Haram), on the day of Hudaybiyyah. Allah said in another Ayah concerning the day of Hudaybiyyah,</p><p>هُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْهَدْىَ مَعْكُوفاً أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ</p><p>(They are the ones who disbelieved and hindered you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram and detained the sacrificial animals, from reaching their place of sacrifice.) 48:25 Allah said next,</p><p>فَمَا اسْتَقَـمُواْ لَكُمْ فَاسْتَقِيمُواْ لَهُمْ</p><p>(So long as they are true to you, stand you true to them.), if they keep the terms of the treaties you conducted with them, including peace between you and them for ten years,</p><p>فَاسْتَقِيمُواْ لَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(then stand you true to them. Verily, Allah loves those who have Taqwa.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Muslims preserved the terms of the treaty with the people of Makkah from the month of Dhul-Qa`dah in the sixth year of Hijrah, until the Quraysh broke it and helped their allies, Banu Bakr, against Khuza`ah, the allies of Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Aided by the Quraysh, Banu Bakr killed some of Bani Khuza`ah in the Sacred Area! The Messenger of Allah ﷺ led an invasion army in the month of Ramadan, of the eighth year, and Allah opened the Sacred Area for him to rule over them, all thanks are due to Allah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ freed the Quraysh who embraced Islam after they were overpowered and defeated. These numbered around two thousands, and they were refered to by the name `Tulaqa' afterwards. Those among them who remained in disbelief and ran away from Allah's Messenger ﷺ were sent promises of safe refuge for four months, during which they were allowed to move about freely. They included Safwan bin Umayyah, `Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl and many others. Allah later on guided them to Islam, and they became excellent believers. Surely, Allah is worthy of all praise for all His actions and decrees.</p>"

1369,"<h2>Everything is a Witness to the Power of Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us about the signs He created that are indicative of His complete power and great might. He made the rays that come forth from the bright sun as the source of light, and made the beams that come forth from the moon as light. He made them of two different natures so they would not be confused with one another. Allah made the dominion of the sun in the daytime and the moon in the night. He ordained phases for the moon, where it starts small then its light increases until it completes a full moon. Then it begins to decrease until it returns to its first phase at the conclusion of the month. Allah said: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَـهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّى عَادَ كَالعُرجُونِ الْقَدِيمِ - لاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ </div><p>(And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk.

He didn't create that for amusement but with great wisdom and perfect reasoning.

1370,
1371,"<h2>The Abode of Those Who deny the Hour is Hell-Fire</h2><p>Allah describes the state of the wretched who disbelieved in the meeting with Allah on the Day of Resurrection and did not look forward to it, who were well-pleased with the life of this world and at rest in it. Al-Hasan said: ""They adorned it and praised it until they were well pleased with it. Whereas they were heedless of Allah's signs in the universe, they did not contemplate them. They were also heedless of Allah's Laws, for they didn't abide by them. Their abode on the Day of Return is Fire, a reward for what they have earned in their worldly life from among their sins and crimes. That is beside their disbelief in Allah, His Messenger and the Last Day."" </p>"
1372,
1373,"<h2>The Good Reward is for the People of Faith and Good Deeds</h2><p>In these two Ayat, Allah promises the happy blessings for those who believed in Allah and His Messengers. And for those that have complied with what they were commanded to follow. The promise is that He will guide them because of their faith, or it may mean through their faith. As to the first interpretation, the meaning is that Allah will guide them on the Day of Resurrection to the straight path until they pass into Paradise because of their faith in this world. The other meaning is that their faith will assist them on the Day of Resurrection as Mujahid said: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِإِيمَانِهِمْ</div><p>(Their Lord will guide them through their faith) meaning ""Their faith will be a light in which they will walk."" </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">دَعْوَهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَـنَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Their way of request therein will be: ""Glory to You, O Allah!"" And Salam (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein! And the close of their request will be: ""All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists."") meaning this is the condition of the people of Paradise. This is similar to what is found in the following Ayat: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">تَحِيَّتُهُمْ يَوْمَ يَلْقَوْنَهُ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(Their greeting on the Day they shall meet Him will be ""Salam Peace!"") 33:44, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: Salam! Salam!!"") 56:25-26, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">سَلاَمٌ قَوْلاً مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ </div><p>((It will be said to them): ""Salam"" -- a Word from the Lord, Most Merciful.) 36:58, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍسَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُمُ</div><p>(And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): ""Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you)!"") 13:23-24 In Allah's statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(And the close of their request will be: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists."") There is an indication that Allah Almighty is the Praised One always, the Worshipped at all times. This is why He praised Himself at the beginning and the duration of His creation. He also praised Himself in the beginning of His Book and the beginning of its revelation. Allah said: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant the Book (the Qur'an).) 18:1, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ</div><p>(All praise is due to Allah, Who (alone) created the heavens and the earth,) 6:1, and many other citations with this meaning. The Ayah also indicates that Allah is the Praised One in this world and in the Hereafter and in all situations. In a Hadith recorded by Muslim: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ يُلْهَمُونَ التَّسْبِيحَ وَالتَّحْمِيدَ كَمَا يُلْهَمُونَ النَّفَس»</div><p>(The people of Paradise will be inspired to glorify Allah and praise Him as they instinctively breath.) This will be their nature because of the increasing bounties of Allah upon them. These bounties are repeated and brought back again and increased with no limit or termination. So praise be to Allah for there is no God but He and no Lord save He. </p>"

Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>أُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ</p><p>(The Ayat whereof are perfect and then explained in detail) This means perfect in its wording, detailed in its meaning. Thus, it is complete in its form and its meaning. This interpretation was reported from Mujahid and Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred it. Concerning the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ</p><p>(from One (Allah), Who is All-Wise, Well-Acquainted.) This means that it (the Qur'an) is from Allah, Who is Most Wise in His statements and His Laws, and Most Aware of the final outcome of matters.</p><p>أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ</p><p>((Saying) worship none but Allah.) This means that this Qur'an descended, perfect and detailed, with the purpose of Allah's worship alone, without any partners. This is similar to the statement of Allah, the Exalted,</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): There is no God but I, so worship Me.) 21:25 It is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): `Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut (calling false deities.)')16:36 In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّنِى لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ</p><p>(Verily, I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.) This means, ""Verily, I am unto you a warner of the punishment if you oppose Him (Allah), and a bringer of the good news of reward if you obey Him."" This meaning has been recorded in the authentic Hadith which states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ascended mount As-Safa and called out to his near relatives of the Quraysh tribe. When they gathered around him, he said,</p><p>«يَا مَعْشَرَ قُرَيْشٍ أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا تُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَلَسْتُمْ مُصَدِّقِيَّ؟»</p><p>(O people of Quraysh, if I informed you that a cavalry was going to attack you in the morning, would you not believe me) They replied, ""We have not found you to be a liar."" He said,</p><p>«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»</p><p>(Verily I am a warner unto you before a severe punishment.) Concerning His statement,</p><p>وَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ</p><p>(And (commanding you): `Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This means, ""I am commanding you to seek forgiveness from previous sins and to turn to Allah from future sins, and thereafter you abide by that.""</p><p>يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(that He may grant you good enjoyment,) This is in reference to this worldly life.</p><p>إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ</p><p>(for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This refers to the Hereafter, according to Qatadah. ""This is like the statement of Allah,</p><p>مَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَوةً طَيِّبَةً</p><p>(Whoever works righteousness -- whether male or female -- while a true believer, verily to him We will give a good life.)16:97 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ</p><p>(But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) This is a severe threat for whoever turns away from the commandments of Allah, the Exalted, and rejects His Messengers.

This means that He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, whether it be goodness towards His Awliya' (friends and allies), or vengeance upon His enemies. This also includes His ability to repeat the creation of His creatures on the Day of Resurrection. This section encourages fear, just as the previous section encourages hope.</p>"

1480,"<h2>Allah created the Heavens and the Earth in Six Days</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs of His power over all things, and that He created the heavens and the earth in six days. He mentions that His Throne was over the water before that, just as Imam Ahmad recorded that `Imran bin Husayn said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا بَنِي تَمِيم»</p><p>(Accept the glad tidings, O tribe of Tamim!) They said, `Verily you have brought us glad tidings and you have given us.' Then he said,</p><p>«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا أَهْلَ الْيَمَن»</p><p>(Accept the glad tidings, O people of Yemen!) They said, `We accept. Therefore, inform us about the beginning of this matter and how it was.' He said,</p><p>«كَانَ اللهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَكَتَبَ فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوظِ ذِكْرَ كُلِّ شَيْء»</p><p>(Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet mentioning everything.) Then a man came to me and said, ""O `Imran, your she camel has escaped from her fetter."" I then went out after her and I do not know what was said after I left."" This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with a variety of wordings. In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلَائِقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»</p><p>(Verily Allah measured the amount of sustenance of the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Under the explanation of this verse, Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك»</p><p>(Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said, `Spend and I will spend on you.') And he said,</p><p>«يَدُ اللهِ مَلْأَى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ، سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَار»</p><p>(Allah's Hand is full, and it is not diminished by spending throughout the night and the day.) He also said,</p><p>«أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَبِيَدِهِ الْمِيزَانُ يَخْفِضُ وَيَرْفَع»</p><p>(Have you seen what has been spent since the creation of the heavens and the earth Verily it does not diminish what is in His Right Hand (in the slightest) and His Throne was over the water. In His Hand is the Scale and he lowers and raises it.) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً</p><p>(that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds.) This means that He created the heavens and the earth for the benefit of His servants, whom He created so that they may worship Him and not associate anything with Him as a partner. Allah did not create this creation (of the heavens and the earth) out of mere frivolity. This is similar to His statement,</p><p>وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ</p><p>(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38: 27 Allah the Exalted, said,</p><p>أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ</p><p>(Did you think that We created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us So Exalted is Allah, the True King: there is no God but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) 51:56 Concerning the statement of Allah,</p><p>لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ</p><p>(that He might try you,) It means so that He (Allah) may test you. Concerning the statement,</p><p>أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً</p><p>(which of you is the best in deeds.) It is important to note here that Allah did not say, ""Which of you has done the most deeds."" Rather, He said, ""Best in deeds."" A deed cannot be considered a good deed until it is done sincerely for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it must be in accordance with the legislation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void.</p><h2>The Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ</p><p>(But if you were to say to them: ""You shall indeed be raised up after death."") Allah, the Exalted, is saying, ""O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject)."" Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,</p><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: ""Allah."")43:87 Allah says,</p><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And if you were to ask them: ""Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon"" They will surely reply: ""Allah."") 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement. Yet, in reference to ability, the resurrection is easier (for Allah to perform) than the original creation. As Allah said,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has perished); and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 Allah also said,</p><p>مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</p><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person.) 31:28 Concerning the statement,</p><p>إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(This is nothing but obvious magic.) The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, ""We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur."" They also say, ""He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ</p><p>(And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term,) Allah, the Exalted, is saying ""If We delay the torment and the destruction of these polytheists until an appointed time and a period determined, and We promise them a specific time period (of life), they would still say, in rejection and haste;</p><p>مَا يَحْبِسُهُ</p><p>(What keeps it back) They mean by this, ""What delays this torment from overtaking us"" Both rejection and doubt are their very nature. Therefore, they have no escape or refuge from the torment.</p><h2>The Meanings of the Word Ummah</h2><p>The word Ummah is used in the Qur'an and Sunnah with a number of different meanings. Sometimes when it is used it means a specified period of time. An example is the statement of Allah, the Exalted, in this verse,</p><p>إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ</p><p>(till a determined Ummah (term),) This is also the meaning in the statement of Allah in Surah Yusuf,</p><p>وَقَالَ الَّذِى نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ</p><p>(Then the man who was released, now after Ummah (some time) remembered.) 12:45 The word Ummah is also used to refer to the Imam (leader) who is followed. An example of this is in the statement of Allah,</p><p>إِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَـنِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p>(Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, obedient to Allah, Hanif, and he was not of those who were polytheists.) 16:120 The word Ummah is also used to mean religion and religious creed. This is as Allah mentions concerning the polytheists, that they said,</p><p>إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, we found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps. ) 43:23 The word Ummah is also used to mean a group (of people). This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ</p><p>(And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): ""Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut."") 16:36 Allah also said,</p><p>وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them. The meaning of Ummah in this context includes the believers and the disbelievers among them. This is like what has been recorded in Sahih Muslim,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»</p><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.) In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,</p><p>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ</p><p>(You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,</p><p>«فَأَقُولُ: أُمَّتِي أُمَّتِي»</p><p>(Then I will say, ""My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!"") The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party. An example of this usage is in the statement of Allah,</p><p>وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ</p><p>(And of the people of Musa there is an Ummah who lead (the men) with truth and established justice therewith.) 7:159 Likewise is His statement,</p><p>مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ</p><p>(A party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right.) 3:113</p>"

The Arabic language is the most eloquent, plain, deep and expressive of the meanings that might arise in one's mind. Therefore, the most honorable Book, was revealed in the most honorable language, to the most honorable Prophet and Messenger , delivered by the most honorable angel, in the most honorable land on earth, and its revelation started during the most honorable month of the year, Ramadan. Therefore, the Qur'an is perfect in every respect. So Allah said,</p><p>نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ الْقَصَصِ بِمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانَ</p><p>(We relate unto you the best of stories through Our revelations unto you, of this Qur'an.)</p><h2>Reason behind revealing Ayah (12:3)</h2><p>On the reason behind revealing Ayah (12:3), Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, ""They said, `O, Allah's Messenger! Why not narrate to us stories' Later on, this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ الْقَصَصِ</p><p>(We relate unto you the best of stories...)"" There is a Hadith that is relevant upon mentioning this honorable Ayah, which praises the Qur'an and demonstrates that it is sufficient from needing all books besides it. Imam Ahmad recorded a narration from Jabir bin `Abdullah that `Umar bin Al-Khattab came to the Prophet with a book that he took from some of the People of the Book. `Umar began reading it to the Prophet who became angry. He said,</p><p>«أَمُتَهَوِّكُونَ فِيهَا يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَقَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِهَا بَيْضَاءَ نَقِيَّةً، لَا تَسْأَلُوهُمْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ فَيُخْبِرُوكُمْ بِحَقَ فَتُكَذِّبُونَهُ، أَوْ بِبَاطِلٍ فَتُصَدِّقُونَهُ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَوْ أَنَّ مُوسَى كَانَ حَيًّا مَا وَسِعَهُ إِلَّا أَنْ يَتَّبِعَنِي»</p><p>(Are you uncertain about it Ibn Al-Khattab By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! I have come to you with it white and pure. Do not ask them about anything, for they might tell you something true and you reject it, or they might tell you something false and you believe it. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If Musa were living, he would have no choice but to follow me.) Imam Ahmad also recorded a narration from `Abdullah bin Thabit who said, ""`Umar came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ and said; `O Messenger of Allah! I passed by a brother of mine from the tribe of Qurayzah, so he wrote some comprehensive statements from the Tawrah for me, should I read them to you' The face of Allah's Messenger ﷺ changed with anger. So I said to him, `Don't you see the face of Allah's Messenger ﷺ"" `Umar said, `We are pleased with Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad ﷺ as our Messenger.' So the anger of the Prophet subsided, and he said,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ، لَوْ أَصْبَحَ فِيكُمْ مُوسَى ثُمَّ اتَّبَعْتُمُوهُ وَتَرَكْتُمُونِي لَضَلَلْتُمْ، إِنَّكُمْ حَظِّي مِنَ الْأُمَمِ، وَأَنَا حَظُّكُمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّين»</p><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad's soul, if Musa appeared among you and you were to follow him, abandoning me, then you would have strayed. Indeed you are my share of the nations, and I am your share of the Prophets.)""</p>"

1600,"<h2>Yusuf's Dream</h2><p>Allah says, `Mention to your people, O Muhammad, among the stories that you narrate to them, the story of Yusuf.' Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) mentioned his dream to his father, Prophet Ya`qub (Jacob), son of Prophet Ishaq (Isaac), son of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), peace be upon them all. `Abdullah bin `Abbas stated that the dreams of Prophets are revelations from Allah. Scholars of Tafsir explained that in Yusuf's dream the eleven stars represent his brothers, who were eleven, and the sun and the moon represent his father and mother. This explanation was collected from Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Sufyan Ath-Thawri and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Yusuf's vision became a reality forty years later, or as some say, eighty years, when Yusuf raised his parents to the throne while his brothers were before him, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَخَرُّواْ لَهُ سُجَّدَا وَقَالَ يأَبَتِ هَـذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَـى مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّى حَقًّا</div><p>(and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: ""O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream aforetime! My Lord has made it come true!"") </p>"
1601,"<h2>Ya`qub orders Yusuf to hide His Vision to avoid Shaytan's Plots</h2><p>Allah narrates the reply Ya`qub gave his son Yusuf when he narrated to him the vision that he saw, which indicated that his brothers would be under his authority. They would be subjugated to Yusuf's authority to such an extent that they would prostrate before him in respect, honor and appreciation. Ya`qub feared that if Yusuf narrated his vision to any of his brothers, they would envy him and conspire evil plots against him. This is why Ya`qub said to Yusuf,</p><p>لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُءْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْدًا</p><p>(Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.) This Ayah means, ""They might arrange a plot against you that causes your demise."" In the Sunnah, there is a confirmed Hadith that states,</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مَا يُحِبُّ فَلْيُحَدِّثْ بِهِ، وَإِذَا رَأَى مَا يَكْرَهُ فَلْيَتَحَوَّلْ إِلَى جَنْبِهِ الْآخَرِ، وَلْيَتْفُلْ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ ثَلَاثًا، وَلْيَسْتَعِذْ بِاللهِ مِنْ شَرِّهَا، وَلَا يُحَدِّثْ بِهَا أَحَدًا فَإِنَّهَا لَنْ تَضُرَّه»</p><p>(If any of you saw a vision that he likes, let him narrate it. If he saw a dream that he dislikes, let him turn on his other side, blow to his left thrice, seek refuge with Allah from its evil and not tell it to anyone. Verily, it will not harm him in this case.) In another Hadith that Imam Ahmad and collectors of the Sunan collected, Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الرُّؤْيَا عَلَى رِجْلِ طَائِرٍ مَا لَمْ تُعْبَرْ، فَإِذَا عُبِرَتْ وَقَعَت»</p><p>(The dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not interpreted. If it is interpreted, it comes true.) Therefore, one should hide the prospects or the coming of a bounty until it comes into existence and becomes known. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اسْتَعِينُوا عَلَى قَضَاءِ الْحَوَائِجِ بِكِتْمَانِهَا، فَإِنَّ كُلَّ ذِي نِعْمَةٍ مَحْسُود»</p><p>(Earn help for fulfilling needs by being discrete, for every owner of a blessing is envied.)</p>"
1602,"<h2>Interpretation of Yusuf's Vision</h2><p>Allah says that Ya`qub said to his son Yusuf, `Just as Allah chose you to see the eleven stars, the sun and the moon prostrate before you in a vision, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَكَذلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ</div><p>(Thus will your Lord choose you) designate and assign you to be a Prophet from Him, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِن تَأْوِيلِ الاٌّحَادِيثِ</div><p>(and teach you the interpretation of Ahadith).'

However, their plot to kill Yusuf would not have succeeded, because Allah the Exalted willed that Yusuf fulfill a mission that must be fulfilled and complete; he would receive Allah's revelation and become His Prophet. Allah willed Yusuf to be a powerful man in Egypt and govern it. Consequently, Allah did not allow them to persist in their intent against Yusuf, through Rubil's words and his advice to them that if they must do something, they should throw him down to the bottom of a well, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ السَّيَّارَةِ</div><p>(he will be picked up by some caravan) of travelers passing by. This way, he said, you will rid yourselves of this bother without having to kill him, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِن كُنتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ</div><p>(if you must do something,) meaning, if you still insist on getting rid of him. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said, ""They agreed to a particularly vicious crime that involved cutting the relation of the womb, undutiful treatment of parents, and harshness towards the young, helpless and sinless. It was also harsh towards the old and weak who have the rights of being respected, honored and appreciated, as well as, being honored with Allah and having parental rights on their offspring. They sought to separate the beloved father, who had reached old age and his bones became weak, yet had a high status with Allah, from his beloved young son, in spite of his weakness, tender age and his need of his father's compassion and kindness. May Allah forgive them, and indeed, He is the Most Merciful among those who have mercy, for they intended to carry out a ""grave error."" Ibn Abi Hatim collected this state- ment, from the route of Salamah bin Al-Fadl from Muhammad bin Ishaq. </p>"

We stated that every Surah that starts with separate letters, affirms that the Qur'an is miraculous and is an evidence that it is a revelation from Allah, and that there is no doubt or denying in this fact. This is why Allah said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">تِلْكَ آيَـتُ الْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(These are the verses of the Book), the Qur'an, which Allah described afterwards,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالَّذِى أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ</div><p>(and that which has been revealed unto you), O Muhammad,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ</div><p>(from your Lord is the truth,) Allah said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(but most men believe not.) just as He said in another Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) 12:103 Allah declares that even after this clear, plain and unequivocal explanation (the Qur'an), most men will still not believe, due to their rebellion, stubbornness and hypocrisy.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">اللَّهُ الَّذِى رَفَعَ السَّمَـوَتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّـى يُدَبَّرُ الاٌّمْرَ يُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ </div>"
1709,"<h2>Clarifying Allah's Perfect Ability</h2><p>Allah mentions His perfect ability and infinite authority, since it is He Who has raised the heavens without pillars by His permission and order. He, by His leave, order and power, has elevated the heavens high above the earth, distant and far away from reach. The heaven nearest to the present world encompasses the earth from all directions, and is also high above it from every direction. The distance between the first heaven and the earth is five hundred years from every direction, and its thickness is also five hundred years. The second heaven surrounds the first heaven from every direction, encompassing everything that the latter carries, with a thickness also of five hundred years and a distance between them of five hundred years. The same is also true about the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh heavens. Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</div><p>(It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof.) 65:12 Allah said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا</div><p>(..without any pillars that you can see.) meaning, `there are pillars, but you cannot see them,' according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and several other scholars. Iyas bin Mu`awiyah said, ""The heaven is like a dome over the earth,"" meaning, without pillars. Similar was reported from Qatadah, and this meaning is better for this part of the Ayah, especially since Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ</div><p>(He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His permission. )22:65 Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">تَرَوْنَهَا</div><p>(..that you can see), affirms that there are no pillars. Rather, the heaven is elevated (above the earth) without pillars, as you see. This meaning best affirms Allah's ability and power.</p><h2>Al-Istawa', Rising above the Throne</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ</div><p>(Then, He rose above (Istawa) the Throne.) We explained the meaning of the Istawa' in Surat Al-A`raf (7:54), and stated that it should be accepted as it is without altering, equating, annulling its meaning, or attempts to explain its true nature. Allah is glorified and praised from all that they attribute to Him.</p><h2>Allah subjected the Sun and the Moon to rotate continuously</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِى لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّـى</div><p>(He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running (its course) for a term appointed.) It was said that the sun and the moon continue their course until they cease doing so upon the commencement of the Final Hour, as Allah stated,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِى لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَـا</div><p>(And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed).)36:38 It was also said that the meaning is: until they settle under the Throne of Allah after passing the other side of the earth. So when they, and the rest of the planetary bodies reach there, they are at the furthest distance from the Throne. Because according to the correct view, which the texts prove, it is shaped like a domb, under which is all of the creation. It is not circular like the celestial bodies, because it has pillars by which it is carried. This fact is clear to those who correctly understand the Ayat and authentic Hadiths. All the (praise is due to) Allah and all the favors are from Him. Allah mentioned the sun and the moon here because they are among the brightest seven heavenly objects. Therefore, if Allah subjected these to His power, then it is clear that He has also subjected all other heavenly objects. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</div><p>(Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.) 41:37 and,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(And (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54 Allah's statement next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يُفَصِّلُ الآيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ</div><p>(He explains the Ayat in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the Meeting with your Lord.) means, He explains the signs and clear evidences that testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him. These evidences prove that He will resurrect creation if He wills, just as He started it.</p>"
1710,"<h2>Allah's Signs on the Earth</h2><p>After Allah mentioned the higher worlds, He started asserting His power, wisdom and control over the lower parts of the world. Allah said,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى مَدَّ الاٌّرْضَ</p><p>(And it is He Who spread out the earth) made it spacious in length and width. Allah has placed on the earth firm mountains and made rivers, springs and water streams run through it, so that the various kinds of fruits and plants of every color, shape, taste and scent are watered with this water,</p><p>مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ</p><p>(and of every kind of fruit He made Zawjayn Ithnayn.), two types from every kind of fruit,</p><p>يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ</p><p>(He brings the night as a cover over the day.) Allah made the day and night pursue each other, when one is about to depart, the other overcomes it, and vice versa. Allah controls time just as He controls space and matter,</p><p>إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(Verily, in these things, there are Ayat for people who reflect.) who reflect on Allah's signs and the evidences of His wisdom. Allah said,</p><p>وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَـوِرَتٌ</p><p>(And in the earth are neighboring tracts, ) Meaning, next to each other, some of them are fertile and produce what benefits people, while others are dead, salty and do not produce anything. This meaning was collected from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and several others. This also covers the various colors and types of diverse areas on the earth; some red, some white, or yellow, or black, some are stony, or flat, or sandy, or thick, or thin, all made to neighbor each other while preserving their own qualities. All this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills, there is no deity or lord except Him. Allah said next,</p><p>وَجَنَّـتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَـبٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ</p><p>(and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields), and date palms...) Allah's statement, next,</p><p>صِنْوَنٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَنٍ</p><p>(Sinwanun wa (or) Ghayru Sinwan.) `Sinwan' means, growing into two or three from a single stem, such as figs, pomegranate and dates. `Ghayru Sinwan' means, having one stem for every tree, as is the case with most plants. From this meaning, the paternal uncle is called one's `Sinw' of his father. There is an authentic Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to `Umar bin Al-Khattab,</p><p>«أَمَا شَعَرْتَ أَنَّ عَمَّ الرَّجُلِ صِنْوُ أَبِيه»</p><p>(Do you not know that man's paternal uncle is the Sinw of his father) Allah said next,</p><p>وَحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ</p><p>(watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.) Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ</p><p>(yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.)</p><p>«الدَّقَلُ، وَالْفَارِسِيُّ، وَالْحُلْوُ، وَالْحَامِض»</p><p>(The Dagal, the Persian, the sweet, the bitter..."") At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said, ""Hasan Gharib."" Therefore, there are differences between plants and fruits with regards to shape, color, taste, scent, blossoms and the shape of their leaves. There are plants that are very sweet or sour, bitter or mild, fresh; some plants have a combination of these attributes, and the taste then changes and becomes another taste, by Allah's will. There is also some that are yellow in color, or red, or white, or black, or blue, and the same can be said about their flowers; and all these variances and complex diversities are watered by the same water. Surely, in this there are signs for those who have sound reasoning, and surely, all this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills and Whose power made distinctions between various things and created them as He wills. So Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Verily, in these things there are Ayat for the people who understand.)</p><p>وَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَئِكَ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدونَ</p>"

1712,"<h2>Denying Resurrection after Death, is Strange</h2><p>Allah says to His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ .</p><p>وَإِن تَعْجَبْ</p><p>(And if you wonder.) at the rejection of the polytheists who deny Resurrection, even though they witness Allah's signs and evidences that He made in His creation which testify that He is able to do everything. Yet, they admit that Allah originated the creation of all things and brought them into existence after they were nothing. However, they deny Allah's claim that He will resurrect the world anew, even though they admit to what is more amazing than what they deny and reject. Therefore, it is amazing that they said,</p><p>أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ</p><p>(When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation) It is an obvious fact to every sane and knowledgeable person that creating the heavens and earth is a greater feat than creating men, and that He Who has originated creation is more able to resurrect it anew,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَعْىَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى بَلَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is able to give life to the dead Yes, He surely is able to do all things)46:33 Allah described those who deny Resurrection,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَئِكَ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ</p><p>(They are those who disbelieved in their Lord! They are those who will have iron chains linking their hands to their necks. ) They will be dragged in the Fire by these chains,</p><p>وَأُوْلـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(They will be dwellers of the Fire to abide therein forever.), for they will remain in Hell forever and will never escape it or be removed from it.</p><p>وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ الْمَثُلَـتُ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p>"
1713,"<h2>The Disbelievers ask for the Punishment to be delivered now!</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ</p><p>(They ask you to hasten), in reference to the disbelievers,</p><p>بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ</p><p>(the evil before the good,) meaning, the punishment. Allah said in other Ayat that they said,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ يأَيُّهَا الَّذِى نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ - لَّوْ</p><p>&nbsp;مَا تَأْتِينَا بِالْمَلَـئِكَةِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ - مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُواْ إِذًا مُّنظَرِينَ</p><p>(And they say: ""O you to whom the Dhikr (the Qur'an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man! Why do you not bring angels to us if you are of the truthful"" We send not the angels down except with the truth (i.e. for torment), and in that case, they (the disbelieves) would have no respite!)15:6-8, and two Ayat;</p><p>وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ</p><p>(And they ask you to hasten on the torment!)29:53-54 Allah also said,</p><p>سَأَلَ سَآئِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ</p><p>(A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall.) 70:1,</p><p>يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا الْحَقُّ</p><p>(Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the very truth.)42:18, and,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا</p><p>(They say: ""Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittana.)38:16, meaning, our due torment and reckoning. Allah said that they also supplicated,</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ</p><p>(And (remember) when they said: ""O Allah! If this (the Qur'an) is indeed the truth from You.)8:32 They were such rebellious, stubborn disbelievers that they asked the Messenger to bring them Allah's torment. Allah replied,</p><p>وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ الْمَثُلَـتُ</p><p>(while exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them.) Meaning, `We have exerted Our punishment on the previous disbelieving nations, and made them a lesson and example for those who might take heed from their destruction.' If it was not for His forbearance and forgiveness, Allah would have indeed punished them sooner. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ</p><p>(And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, He would not leave a moving creature on the surface of the earth.)35:45 Allah said in this honorable Ayah,</p><p>وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ</p><p>(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing.) He is full of forgiveness, pardoning and covering the mistakes of people, in spite of their wrongdoing and the errors committed night and day. Allah next reminds that His punishment is severe, so that fear and hope are both addressed and mentioned. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل رَّبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَسِعَةٍ وَلاَ يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُ عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(If they belie you, say: ""Your Lord is the Owner of vast mercy, and never will His wrath be turned back from the people who are criminals."")6:147</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, your Lord is quick in retribution and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)7:167, and,</p><p>نَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ - وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ ٱلْعَذَابُ ٱلْأَلِيمُ</p><p>(Declare unto My servants that truly I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.)15:49-50 There are many other Ayat that mention both fear and hope.</p><p>وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ</p>"
1714,"<h2>The Idolators ask for a Miracle</h2><p>Allah states that out of their disbelief and stubbornness, the idolators asked why is not a miracle sent down to the Messenger from his Lord, just like the earlier Messengers For instance, the disbelievers were being stubborn when they asked the Prophet to turn As-Safa into gold, to remove the mountains from around them, and to replace them with green fields and rivers.

<p>(And He knows that which is in the wombs.)31:34, whether male or female, fair or ugly, miserable or happy, whether it will have a long or a short life. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>

<p>«فَيَقُولُ الْمَلَكُ: أَيْ رَبِّ أَذَكَرٌ أَمْ أُنْثَى؟ أَيْ رَبِّ أَشَقِيٌّ أَمْ سَعِيدٌ؟ فَمَا الرِّزْقٌ؟ فَمَا الْأَجَلُ؟ فَيَقُولُ اللهُ: وَيَكْتُبُ الْمَلَك»</p>
<p>(Then the angel asks, ""O my Lord! Is it a male or a female, miserable or happy, what is its provisions and life span"" Allah then ordains and the angel records it.) Allah said next,</p>
<p>وَمَا تَغِيضُ الاٌّرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ</p>
<p>(and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed.) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«مَفَاتِيحُ الْغَيْبِ خَمْسٌ، لَا يَعْلَمُهُنَّ إِلَّا اللهُ: لَا يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي غَدٍ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا يَعْلَمُ مَا تَغِيضُ الْأَرْحَامُ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا يَعْلَمُ مَتَى يَأْتِي الْمَطَرُ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ، وَلَا يَعْلَمُ مَتَى تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ إِلَّا الله»</p>
<p>(The Keys of the Ghayb (unseen knowledge) are five, nobody knows them but Allah. Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow except Allah; nobody knows what is in the womb except Allah; nobody knows when it will rain except Allah; no soul knows at what place he will die except Allah; and nobody knows when the (Final) Hour will begin except Allah.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p>وَمَا تَغِيضُ الاٌّرْحَامُ</p>
<p>(and by how much the wombs fall short), this refers to miscarriages,</p>
<p>وَمَا تَزْدَادُ</p>
<p>(or exceed), this refers to carrying her fetus in her womb for the full term. Some women carry their fetus for ten months, while others for nine months. Some terms are longer or shorter than others. This is the falling short or exceeding that Allah the Exalted mentioned, and all this occurs by His knowledge."" Qatadah commented on Allah's statement,</p>
<p>وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ</p>
<p>(Everything with Him is in proportion.) ""For a term appointed. Allah has the records of the provisions and terms of His creation and made an appointed term for everything."" An authentic Hadith mentioned that one of the Prophet's daughters sent (a messenger) to him requesting him to come as her child was dying, but the Prophet ﷺ returned the messenger and told him to say to her,</p>
<p>«إِنَّ للهِ مَا أَخَذَ، وَلَهُ مَا أَعْطَى، وَكُلُّ شَيْءٍ عِنْدَهُ بِأَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى، فَمُرُوهَا فَلْتَصْبِرْ وَلْتَحْتَسِب»</p>
<p>(Verily, whatever Allah takes is for Him and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world), and so she should be patient and hope for Allah's reward.) Allah said next,</p>
<p>عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ</p>
<p>(All-Knower of the Ghayb (the unseen) and the Shahadah (the witnessable),) Who knows everything that the servants see and all what they cannot see, and none of it ever escapes His knowledge,</p>
<p>الْكَبِيرُ</p>
<p>(the Most Great), greater than everything,</p>
<p>الْمُتَعَالِ</p>
<p>(the Most High.) above everything,</p>
<p>قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمَا</p>

1717,"<h2>Allah's Knowledge encompasses all Things Apparent and Hidden</h2><p>Allah declares that His knowledge is encompassing all of His creation, those who declare their speech or hide it, He hears it and nothing of it ever escapes His observation. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.)20:7, and,</p><p>وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ</p><p>(And (Allah) knows what you conceal and what you reveal.) `A'ishah said, ""All praise is due to Allah Whose hearing has encompassed all voices! By Allah, she who came to complain about her husband to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was speaking while I was in another part of the room, yet I did not hear some of what she said. Allah sent down,</p><p>قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِى إِلَى اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمآ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband and complains to Allah. And Allah hears the argument between you both.

Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>أَلا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ</p><p>(Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments.) 11:5, and,</p><p>وَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ وَمَا يَعْزُبُ عَن رَّبِّكَ مِن مِّثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فِى السَّمَآءِ وَلاَ أَصْغَرَ مِن ذَلِكَ وَلا أَكْبَرَ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an nor you do any deed, but We are witness thereof when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the a speck of dust on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record.)10:61</p><h2>The Guardian Angels</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>لَهُ مُعَقِّبَـتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(For him (each person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.) Allah states that there are angels who take turns guarding each servant, some by night and some by day. These angels protect each person from harm and accidents. There are also angels who take turns recording the good and evil deeds, some angels do this by day and some by night. There are two angels, one to the right and one to the left of each person, recording the deeds. The angel to the right records the good deeds, while the angel to the left records the evil deeds. There are also two angels that guard and protect each person, one from the back and one from in front. Therefore, there are four angels that surround each person by day and they are replaced by four others at night, two scribes and two guards. An authentic Hadith states,</p><p>«يَتَعَاقَبُونَ فِيكُمْ مَلَائِكَةٌ بِاللَّيْلِ وَمَلَائِكَةٌ بالنَّهَارِ، وَيَجْتَمِعُونَ فِي صَلَاةِ الصُّبْحِ وَصَلَاةِ الْعَصْرِ، فَيَصْعَدُ إِلَيْهِ الَّذِينَ بَاتُوا فِيكُمْ فَيَسْأَلُهُمْ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ: كَيْفَ تَرَكْتُمْ عِبَادِي؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَتَيْنَاهُمْ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ، وَتَرَكْنَاهُمْ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّون»</p><p>(Angels take turns around you, some at night and some by day, and all of them assemble together at the time of the Fajr and `Asr prayers. Then those who have stayed with you throughout the night, ascend to Allah Who asks them, and He knows the answer better than they about you, ""How have you left My servants"" They reply, ""As we have found them praying, we have left them praying."") Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَقَدْ وُكِّلَ بِهِ قَرِينُهُ مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَقَرِينُهُ مِنَ الْمَلَائِكَة»</p><p>(Verily, every one among you has his companion from the Jinn and his companion from the angels."") They said, ""And you too, O Allah's Messenger"" He said,</p><p>«وَإِيَّايَ، وَلَكِنَّ اللهَ أَعَانَنِي عَلَيْهِ، فَلَا يَأْمُرُنِي إِلَّا بِخَيْر»</p><p>(And I too, except that Allah has helped me against him, so he only orders me to do good.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibrahim said, ""Allah revealed to a Prophet from among the Children of Israel, `Say to your nation: every people of a village or a house who used to obey Allah but changed their behavior to disobeying Him, then He will take away from them what they like and exchange it for what they dislike."" Ibrahim next said that this statement has proof in Allah's Book,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُواْ مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ</p><p>(Verily, Allah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves.)</p>"

1754,"<h2>Every Prophet was sent with the Language of His People; Guidance or Misguidance follows the Explanation</h2><p>Allah is Kind and Compassionate with His creation, sending Messengers to them from among them and speaking their language, so that they are able to understand the Message that the Messengers were sent with. Allah said next,</p><p>فَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ</p><p>(Then Allah misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills.) after the proof and evidence have been established for the people, Allah misguides whom He wills from the path of guidance and guides whom He wills to the truth,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Mighty,) whatever He wills occurs and whatever He does not will never occurs,</p><p>الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(the All-Wise.) in His decisions, misleading those who deserve to be misled and guiding those who deserve guidance. This is from Allah's wisdom with His creation, every Prophet He sent to a people spoke their language and everyone of these Prophets were only sent to their people. Muhammad bin `Abdullah, Allah's Messenger ﷺ, was sent to all people. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي:نُصِرْتُ بِالرُّعْبِ مَسِيرَةَ شَهْرٍ، وَجُعِلَتِ لِيَ الْأَرْضُ مَسْجِدًا وَطَهُورًا، وَأُحِلَّتْ لِيَ الْغَنَائِمُ وَلَمْ تُحَلَّ لِأَحَدٍ قَبْلِي، وَأُعْطِيتُ الشَّفَاعَةَ، وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»</p><p>(I have been given five things which were not given to Anyone else before me.

This is when Allah delivered them from their enemy, made a passage for them through the sea, shaded them with clouds, sent down manna and quails for them, and other favors and bounties. Mujahid, Qatadah and several others said this. Allah said next,</p><p>إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ</p><p>(Truly, therein are Ayat for every patient, thankful (person).) Allah says, `Our delivering of Our loyal supporters among the Children of Israel from the grasp of Fir`awn and saving them from the disgraceful torment, provides a lesson to draw from for those who are patient in the face of affliction, and thankful in times of prosperity. Qatadah said, ""Excellent is the servant who if he is tested, he observes patience, and if he is granted prosperity, he is thankful for it."" It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَمْرَ الْمُؤْمِنِ كُلَّهُ عَجَبٌ، لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ لَهُ قَضَاءً إِلَّا كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَه»</p><p>(Verily, all of the matter of the believer is amazing, for every decision that Allah decrees for him is good for him.

Allah delivered them from all this torment, and this is a great bounty, indeed. This is why Allah described this affliction,</p><p>وَفِى ذَلِكُمْ بَلاَءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(and in it was a tremendous trial from your Lord.) `for He granted you (O Children of Israel) a great favor for which you are unable to perfectly thank Him.' Some scholars said that this part of the Ayah means, `what Fir`awn used to do to you was a tremendous</p><p>بَلاَءً</p><p>(trial.)' Both meanings might be considered here and Allah knows best.

It is possible that this Ayah means, your Lord has vowed and sworn by His might, grace and exaltness. Allah said in a similar Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكَ لَيَبْعَثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ</p><p>(And (remember) when your Lord declared that He would certainly keep on sending against them (i.e. the Jews), till the Day of Resurrection.) 7:167 Allah said,</p><p>لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ</p><p>(If you give thanks, I will give you more;) meaning, `if you appreciate My favor on you, I will give you more of it,</p><p>وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ</p><p>(but if you are thankless) if you are not thankful for My favors, covering and denying, them,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابِى لَشَدِيدٌ</p><p>(verily, My punishment is indeed severe), by depriving you of the favor and punishing you for being unappreciative of it.'

It is also said that it means, they placed their hands on their mouths in denial of the Messengers. It was also said that it means that they did not answer the call of the Messengers, or they were biting their hands in rage. Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Qatadah said that they belied the Messengers and refuted their call with their mouths.

He is independent of His creation, alone with no partner or associate. For this reason He deserves to be worshipped Alone, without partners.

This is a reference to how their flanks become fat, their udders fill with milk and their humps become bigger. </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَحِينَ تَسْرَحُونَ</div><p>(and as you lead them forth to pasture (in the morning).) meaning when you send them out to the pasture in the morning. </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَتَحْمِلُ أَثْقَالَكُمْ</div><p>(And they carry your loads) meaning the heavy burdens that you cannot move or carry by yourselves </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلَى بَلَدٍ لَّمْ تَكُونُواْ بَـلِغِيهِ إِلاَّ بِشِقِّ الأَنفُسِ</div><p>(to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves) meaning journeys for Hajj, `Umrah, military campaigns, and journeys for the purpose of trading, and so on. They use these animals for all kinds of purposes, for riding and for carrying loads, as Allah says: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِى الاٌّنْعَـمِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهَا وَلَكُمْ فيِهَا مَنَـفِعُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ - وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ </div><p>(And verily, there is indeed a lesson for you in the An'am (cattle). We give you to drink (milk) of that which is in their bellies. And there are numerous (other) benefits in them for you. Of them you eat, and on them and on ships you are carried.) (23:21-22) </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">اللَّهُ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّنْعَـمَ لِتَرْكَـبُواْ مِنْهَا وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ - وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَـفِعُ وَلِتَـبْلُغُواْ عَلَيْهَا حَاجَةً فِى صُدُورِكُمْ وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ - وَيُرِيكُمْ ءَايَـتِهِ فَأَىَّ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ تُنكِرُونَ </div><p>(Allah, it is He Who has made cattle for you, so that some you may ride, and some you may eat. And you find (many other) benefits in them; you may reach by their means a desire that is in your breasts (i.e. carry your goods, loads), and on them and on ships you are carried. And He shows you His Ayat. Which, then of the Ayat of Allah do you deny) (40:79-81). Thus here Allah says, after enumerating these blessings, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ لَرَؤُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(Truly, your Lord is full of kindness, Most Merciful.) meaning, your Lord is the One Who has subjugated the An`am (cattle) to you. This is like the Ayat: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعـماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَـلِكُونَ - وَذَلَّلْنَـهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ </div><p>(Do they not see, that of what Our Hands have created, We created the An'am (cattle) for them, so that they may own them, and We subdued them so that they may ride some and they may eat some.)(36:71-72). </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ - لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ - وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And He made mounts for you out of ships and cattle.

And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return!"") (43:12-14) Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَكُمْ فِيهَا دِفْءٌ</div><p>(In them there is warmth) refers to clothing; </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَنَـفِعُ</div><p>(and numerous benefits) refers to the ways in which they derive the benefits of food and drink from them."" </p>"

1908,
1909,"<h2>This refers to another category of animals that Allah has created as a blessing for His servants; horses, mules and donkeys, all of which He made for riding and adornment.</h2><p>This is the main purpose for which these animals were created. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Jabir bin `Abdullah said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade us to eat the meat of domestic donkeys, but he allowed us to eat the meat of horses."" Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud reported with two chains of narration, each of which meet the conditions of Muslim, that Jabir said: ""On the day of Khaybar we slaughtered horses, mules and donkeys. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade us from eating the mules and donkeys, but he did not forbid us from eating the horses."" According to Sahih Muslim, Asma' bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: ""At the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ we slaughtered a horse and ate it when we were in Al-Madinah.""</p>"
1910,"<h2>Explanation of the Different Religious Paths</h2><p>When Allah mentioned the animals which may be used for the purpose of physical journeys, He also referred to the moral, religious routes that people may follow. Often in the Qur'an there is a shift from physical or tangible things to beneficial spiritual and religious matters, as when Allah says, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) 2:197 And, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَـبَنِى آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَرِى سَوْءَتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(O Children of Adam! We have granted clothing for you to cover yourselves, as well as for adornment; but the raiment of righteousness, that is better.) 7:26 Since Allah mentioned cattle and other such animals in this Surah, all of which are ridden or can be used in any way necessary, carrying people's necessities for them to distant places and on difficult journeys - then He mentions the ways which people follow to try to reach Him, and explains that the right way is the one that does reach Him. He says: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(And it is up to Allah to show the right way.) This is like the Ayat, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَنَّ هَـذَا صِرَطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</div><p>(And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and do not follow the (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path.) 6:153 and, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَالَ هَذَا صِرَطٌ عَلَىَّ مُسْتَقِيمٌ </div><p>((Allah) said: ""This is the way which will lead straight to Me."") (15:41) </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(And it is up to Allah to show the right way.) Mujahid said: ""The true way is up to Allah."" </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(And it is up to Allah to show the right way.) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said: ""It is up to Allah to clarify, to explain the guidance and misguidance."" This was also reported by `Ali bin Abi Talhah, and was also the opinion of Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. Hence Allah said: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِنْهَا جَآئِرٌ</div><p>(But there are ways that stray.) meaning they deviate from the truth. Ibn `Abbas and others said: ""These are the different ways,"" and various opinions and whims, such as Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism. Ibn Mas`ud recited it as (وَمِنْكُمْ جَائِرٌ) ""But among you are those who stray. "" Then Allah tells us that all of that happens by His will and decree. He says: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</div><p>(And had He willed, He would have guided you all.) And Allah says: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا</div><p>(If your Lord had willed, then all who are in the earth would have believed.) 10:99 </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ </div><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبّكَ لاَمْلاَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ-</div><p>(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made humanity one Ummah, but they will not stop disagreeing. Except those for whom your Lord has granted mercy. And it is for this that He did create them; and the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled (i.e. His saying): ""Surely, I shall fill Hell with Jinn and men all together."") (11:118-119). </p>"
1911,"<h2>The Blessings of Rain, and explaining how it is one of the Signs</h2><p>When Allah mentions the blessings of cattle and other animals that He has granted mankind, He then mentions how He has blessed them by sending rain down from the sky above, which has been fulfilling the needs and bringing joy to people and their cattle. Allah says: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَّكُم مَّنْهُ شَرَابٌ</div><p>(from it you drink) meaning, He made it fresh and pure so that they can drink it, not salty and undrinkable. </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِنْهُ شَجَرٌ فِيهِ تُسِيمُونَ</div><p>(and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture.) meaning, from it He raised plants on which your cattle graze. Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd, all said that this refers to grazing animals including camels. </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يُنبِتُ لَكُمْ بِهِ الزَّرْعَ وَالزَّيْتُونَ وَالنَّخِيلَ وَالأَعْنَـبَ وَمِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ</div><p>(With it He causes crops to grow for you, olives, date palms, grapes, and every kind of fruit.) meaning, with this one kind of water, He makes the earth sprout plants with different tastes, colors, scents and shapes. For this reason He says, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</div><p>(Verily, in this there is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought.) meaning, this is a sign and a proof that there is no god besides Allah, as He says: </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَمَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَنبَتْنَا بِهِ حَدَآئِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍ مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنبِتُواْ شَجَرَهَا أَإِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ </div><p>(Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends water down for you from the sky, from which We cause wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight to grow You are not able to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any ilah (god) with Allah Nay, but they are a people who make equals (to Him)!) (27:60). </p>"
2030,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Isra'</h2><p>Imam Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Muhammad bin Isma`il Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said concerning Surah Bani Isra`il (i.e., Surat Al-Isra'), Al-Kahf and Maryam: ""They are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasure."" Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to fast until we would say, he does not want to break his fast, then he would not fast until we would say, he does not want to fast, and he used to recite Bani Isra'il and Az-Zumar every night.""</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Isra' (Night Journey)</h2><p>Allah glorifies Himself, for His ability to do that which none but He can do, for there is no God but He and no Lord besides Him.</p><p>الَّذِى أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ</p><p>(Who took His servant for a Journey) refers to Muhammad</p><p>لَيْلاً</p><p>(by Night) means, in the depths of the night.</p><p>مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p>(from Al-Masjid Al-Haram) means the Masjid in Makkah.</p><p>إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الاٌّقْصَى</p><p>(to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa,) means the Sacred House which is in Jerusalem, the origin of the Prophets from the time of Ibrahim Al-Khalil. The Prophets all gathered there, and he (Muhammad ﷺ) led them in prayer in their own homeland.

One stride of this creature covered a distance as far as it could see. I rode on it and it took me to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), where I tethered it at the hitching post of the Prophets. Then I entered and prayed two Rak`ahs there, and came out. Jibril brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk, and I chose the milk. Jibril said: `You have chosen the Fitrah (natural instinct).' Then I was taken up to the first heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw Adam, who welcomed me and prayed for good for me. Then I was taken up to the second heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw the two maternal cousins, Yahya and `Isa, who welcomed me and prayed for good for me. Then I was taken up to the third heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw Yusuf, who had been given the beautiful half. He welcomed me and prayed for good for me. Then I was taken up to the fourth heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw Idris, who welcomed me and prayed for good for me. - then (the Prophet ) said: Allah says:</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَاهُ مَكَاناً عَلِيّاً</p><p>(And We raised him to a high station) (19:57).</p><p>ثُمَّ عُرِجَ بِنَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الْخَامِسَةِ فَاسْتَفْتَحَ جِبْرِيلُ فَقِيلَ: مَنْ أَنْتَ؟ قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ قِيلَ: وَمَنْ مَعَكَ؟ قَالَ: مُحَمَّدٌ قِيلَ: وَقَدْ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ؟ قَالَ: قَدْ بُعِثَ إِلَيْهِ. فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَإِذَا أَنَا بِهَارُونَ فَرَحَّبَ بِي وَدَعَا لِي بِخَيْرٍ ثُمَّ عُرِجَ بِنَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ السَّادِسَةِ فَاسْتَفْتَحَ جِبْرِيلُ فَقِيلَ مَنْ أَنْتَ؟ قَالَ: جِبْرِيلُ قِيلَ: وَمَنْ مَعَكَ؟ قَالَ: مُحَمَّدٌ قِيلَ: وَقَدْ بُعِثَ إِلَيْهِ؟ قَالَ: قَدْ بُعِثَ إِلَيْهِ. فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَإِذَا أَنَا بِمُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ فَرَحَّبَ بِي وَدَعَا لِي بِخَيْرٍ ثُمَّ عُرِجَ بِنَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ السَّابِعَةِ فَاسْتَفْتَحَ جِبْرِيلُ فَقِيلَ مَنْ أَنْتَ؟ قَالَ: جِبْرِيلُ قِيلَ: وَمَنْ مَعَكَ؟ قَالَ: مُحَمَّدٌ قِيلَ: وَقَدْ بُعِثَ إِلَيْهِ؟ قَالَ: قَدْ بُعِثَ إِلَيْهِ. فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَإِذَا أَنَا بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، وَإِذَا هُوَ مُسْتَنِدٌ إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ مَلَكٍ ثُمَّ لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ، ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ بِي إِلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَإِذَا ثَمَرُهَا كَالْقِلَالِ، فَلَمَّا غَشِيَهَا مِنْ أَمْرِ اللهِ مَا غَشِيَهَا تَغَيَّرَتْ فَمَا أَحَدٌ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللهِ تَعَالَى يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَصِفَهَا مِنْ حُسْنِهَا. قَالَ: فَأَوْحَى اللهُ إِلَيَّ مَا أَوْحَى، وَقَدْ فَرَضَ عَلَيَّ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً فَنَزَلَتُ حَتَّى انْتَهَيْتُ إِلَى مُوسَى، قَالَ: مَا فَرَضَ رَبُّك عَلَى أُمَّتِكَ؟ قُلْتُ: خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ، قَالَ:ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ التَّخْفِيفَ لِأُمَّتِكَ، فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ وَإِنِّي قَدْ بَلَوْتُ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ وَخَبَرْتُهُمْ، قَالَ: فَرَجَعْتُ إِلَى رَبِّي فَقُلْتُ أَيْ رَبِّ خَفِّفْ عَنْ أُمَّتِي فَحَطَّ عَنِّي خَمْسًا، فَنَزَلَتُ حَتَّى انْتَهَيْتُ إِلَى مُوسَى فَقَالَ: مَا فَعَلْتَ؟ فَقُلْتُ: قَدْ حَطَّ عَنِّي خَمْسًا فَقَالَ: إِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ فَارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ التَّخْفِيفَ لِأُمَّتِكَ، قَالَ: فَلَمْ أَزَلْ أَرْجِعُ بَيْنَ رَبِّي وَبَيْنَ مُوسَى وَيَحُطُّ عَنِّي خَمْسًا خَمْسًا حَتَّى قَالَ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ هُنَّ خَمْسُ صَلَوَاتٍ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ بِكُلِّ صَلَاةٍ عَشْرٌ، فَتِلْكَ خَمْسُونَ صَلَاةً وَمَنْ هَمَّ بِحَسَنَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ حَسَنَةً، فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا كُتِبَتْ عَشْرًا، وَمَنْ هَمَّ بِسَيِّئَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا لَمْ تُكْتَبْ شَيْئًا، فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا كُتِبَتْ سَيِّئَةً وَاحِدَةً، فَنَزَلَتُ حَتَّى انْتَهَيْتُ إِلَى مُوسَى فَأَخْبَرْتُهُ، فَقَالَ: ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ التَّخْفِيفَ لِأُمَّتِكَ فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ، فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم:</p><p>«لَقَدْ رَجَعْتُ إِلى رَبِّي حَتَّى اسْتَحْيَيْت»</p><p>Then he resumed his narrative: (Then I was taken up to the fifth heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw Harun, who welcomed me and prayed for good for me. Then I was taken up to the sixth heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril. It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw Musa, who welcomed me and prayed for good for me. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who are you' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was asked, `Has his Mission started' He said, `His Mission has started.' So it was opened for us, and there I saw Ibrahim, who was leaning back against the Much-Frequented House (Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur). Every day seventy thousand angels enter it, then they never come back to it again. Then I was taken to Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the Lote tree beyond which none may pass), and its leaves were like the leaves ears of elephants and its fruits were like jugs, and when it was veiled with whatever it was veiled with by the command of Allah, it changed, and none of the creatures of Allah can describe it because it is so beautiful. Then Allah revealed that which He revealed to me. He enjoined on me fifty prayers every day and night. I came down until I reached Musa, and he said, `What did your Lord enjoin on your Ummah' I said, `Fifty prayers everyday and night.' He said, `Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce (the burden) for your Ummah, for your Ummah will not be able to do that. I tested the Children of Israel and found out how they were.' So I went back to my Lord and said, `O Lord, reduce (the burden) for my Ummah for they will never be able to do that.' So He reduced it by five. I came back down until I met Musa and he asked me, `What did you do' I said, `(My Lord) reduced (my burden) by five.' He said, `Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce (the burden) for your Ummah.' I kept going back between my Lord and Musa, and (my Lord) reduced it by five each time, until He said, `O Muhammad, these are five prayers every day and night, and for every prayer there is (the reward of) ten, so they are (like) fifty prayers. Whoever wants to do something good then does not do it, one good deed will be recorded for him, and if he does it, ten good deeds will be recorded for him. Whoever wants to do something evil and does not do it, no evil deed will be recorded for him, and if he does it, one evil deed will be recorded for him.' I came down until I reached Musa, and told him about this. He said: `Go back to your Lord and ask him to reduce (the burden) for your Ummah, for they will never be able to do that.' I had kept going back to my Lord until I felt too shy.) This version was also recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded Anas saying that Al-Buraq was brought to the Prophet on the Night of the Isra' with his saddle and reins ready for riding. The animal shied, and Jibril said to him: ""Why are you doing this By Allah, no one has ever ridden you who is more honored by Allah than him."" At this, Al-Buraq started to sweat. This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said it is Gharib. Ahmad also recorded that Anas said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَمَّا عَرَجَ بِي رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مَرَرْتُ بِقَوْمٍ لَهُمْ أَظْفَارٌ مِنْ نُحَاسٍ يَخْمِشُونَ بِهَا وُجُوهَهُمْ وَصُدُورَهُمْ، فَقُلْتُ: مَنْ هؤُلَاءِ يَا جِبْرِيلُ؟ قَالَ: هَؤُلَاءِ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ لُحُومَ النَّاسِ وَيَقَعُونَ فِي أَعْرَاضِهِم»</p><p>(When I was taken up to my Lord (during Al-Mi'raj), I passed by people who had nails of copper with which they were scratching their faces and chests. I asked, `Who are these, O Jibril' He said, `These are those who ate the flesh of the people i.e., backbiting and slandered their honor.') This was also recorded by Abu Dawud. Anas also said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَرَرْتُ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي عَلَى مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ قَائِمًا يُصَلِّي فِي قَبْرِه»</p><p>(On the night when I was taken on my Night Journey (Al-Isra'), I passed by Musa, who was standing, praying in his grave.) This was also recorded by Muslim.</p><h2>The Report of Anas bin Malik from Malik bin Sa`sa`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that Malik bin Sa`sa`ah told him that the Prophet of Allah told them about the night in which he was taken on the Night Journey (Al-Isra'). He said:</p><p>«بَيْنَمَا أَنَا فِي الْحَطِيمِ وَرُبَّمَا قَالَ قَتَادَةُ: فِي الْحِجْرِ مُضْطَجِعًا إِذْ أَتَانِي آتٍ، فَجَعَلَ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ الْأَوْسَطِ بَيْنَ الثَّلَاثَةِ قَالَ فَأَتَانِي فَقَدَّ سَمِعْتُ قَتَادَةَ يَقُولُ: فَشَقَّ مَا بَيْنَ هَذِهِ إِلَى هَذِه»</p><p>(While I was lying down in Al-Hatim (or maybe, Qatadah said, in Al-Hijr) 'someone came to me and said to his companion, `The one who is in the middle of these three.' He came to me and opened me.) I one of the narrators heard Qatadah say, `split me - from here to here.' Qatadah said: ""I said to Al-Jarud, who was beside me, `What does that mean' He said, `From the top of his chest to below his navel', and I heard him say, `from his throat to below his navel'. The Prophet said:</p><p>«فَاسْتُخْرِجَ قَلْبِي قَالَ فَأُتِيتُ بِطَسْتٍ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ مَمْلُوءَةٍ إِيمَانًا وَحِكْمَةً فَغُسِلَ قَلْبِي ثُمَّ حُشِيَ ثُمَّ أُعِيدَ ثُمَّ أُتِيتُ بِدَابَّةٍ دُونَ الْبَغْلِ وَفَوْقَ الْحِمَارِ أَبْيَض»</p><p>(He took out my heart and brought a golden vessel filled with faith and wisdom. He washed my heart then filled it up and put it back, then a white animal was brought to me that was smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey.) Al-Jarud said, `Was this Al-Buraq, O Abu Hamzah' He said, `Yes, and its stride covered a distance as far as it could see.' The Prophet said:</p><p>«فَحُمِلْتُ عَلَيْهِ فَانْطَلَقَ بِي جِبْرِيلُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ حَتَّى أَتَى بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا فَاسْتَفْتَحَ، فَقِيلَ: مَنْ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: جِبْرِيلُ، قِيلَ: وَمَنْ مَعَكَ؟ قَالَ: مُحَمَّدٌ، قِيلَ: أَوَ قَدْ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ فَقِيلَ: مَرْحَبًا بِهِ وَلَنِعْمَ الْمَجِيءُ جَاءَ قَالَ فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَلَمَّا خَلَصْتُ فَإِذَا فِيهَا آدَمُ عَلَيهِ السَّلَامُ، قَالَ: هَذَا أَبُوكَ آدَمُ فَسَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِ، فَسَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ فَرَدَّ السَّلَامَ ثُمَّ قَالَ: مَرْحَبًا بِالْابْنِ الصَّالِحِ وَالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ، قَالَ فَلَمَّا تَجَاوَزْتُهُ بَكَى قِيلَ لَهُ: مَا يُبْكِيكَ؟ قَالَ: أَبْكِي لأَنَّ غُلَامًا بُعِثَ بَعْدِي يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أُمَّتِهِ أَكْثَرُ مِمَّا يَدْخُلُهَا مِنْ أُمَّتِي. قَالَ: ثُمَّ صَعِدَ حَتَّى أَتَى السَّمَاءَ السَّابِعَةَ فَاسْتَفْتَحَ قِيلَ: مَنْ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: جبْرِيلُ، قِيلَ: وَمَنْ مَعَكَ؟ قَالَ: مُحَمَّدٌ، قِيلَ: أَوَ قَدْ بُعِثَ إِلَيْهِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، قِيلَ: مَرْحَبًا بِهِ وَلَنِعْمَ الْمَجِيءُ جَاءَ، قَالَ: فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَلَمَّا خَلَصْتُ فَإِذَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ فَقَالَ: هَذَا إبْرَاهِيمُ فَسَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ: فَسَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ فَرَدَّ السَّلَامَ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: مَرْحَبًا بِالْابْنِ الصَّالِحِ وَالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ قَالَ ثُمَّ رُفِعَتْ إِلَيَّ سِدْرَةُ الْمُنْتَهَى فَإِذَا نَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَرَ، وَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا مِثْلُ آذَانِ الْفِيَلةِ، فَقَالَ: هَذِهِ سِدْرَةُ الْمُنْتَهَى، قَالَ: وَإِذَا أَرْبَعَةُ أَنْهَارٍ: نَهْرَانِ بَاطِنَانِ وَنَهْرَانِ ظَاهِرَانِ، فَقُلْتُ: مَا هَذَا يَا جِبْرِيلُ؟ قَالَ: أَمَّا الْبَاطِنَانِ فَنَهْرَانِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَأَمَّا الظَّاهِرَانِ فَالنِّيلُ وَالْفُرَاتُ قَالَ ثُمَّ رُفِعَ إِلَيَّ الْبَيْتُ الْمَعْمُور»</p><p>(I was mounted upon it and Jibril brought me to the first heaven, and asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who is this' He said, `Jibril.' It was said, `Who is with you' He said, `Muhammad.' It was said, `Has his Mission started' He said, `Yes.' It was said, `Welcome to him, blessed is the one who comes.' So it was opened for us and when I entered, I saw Adam. (Jibril) said, `This is your father Adam, greet him.'

Then I was taken up to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, whose fruits like the clay jugs of Hajar (a region in Arabia) and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. (Jibril) said: `This is Sidrat Al-Muntaha.' And there were four rivers, two hidden and two visible. I said, `What is this, O Jibril' He said, `The two hidden rivers are rivers in Paradise, and the two visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then I was shown Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.) Qatadah said: Al-Hasan told us narrating from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet saw Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. Each day seventy thousand angels enter it, then they never return from it.

I tried the people before you, I had to deal with the Children of Israel and it was very difficult for me. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce the burden on your Ummah.' So I went back, and the number was reduced by ten. I came back to Musa and he asked, `What were you commanded to do' I said, `Twenty prayers each day.' He said, `Your Ummah will not be able to do twenty prayers each day. I tried the people before you, I had to deal with the Children of Israel and it was very difficult for me. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce the burden on your Ummah.' So I went back, and the number was reduced by ten more. I came back to Musa and he asked, `What were you commanded to do' I said, `Ten prayers each day.' He said, `Your Ummah will not be able to do ten prayers each day. I tried the people before you, I had to deal with the Children of Israel and it was very difficult for me. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce the burden on your Ummah.' So I went back, and I was commanded to do five prayers every day. I came back to Musa and he asked, `What were you commanded to do' I said, `Five prayers each day.' He said, `Your Ummah will not be able to do five prayers each day. I tried the people before you, I had to deal with the Children of Israel and it was very difficult for me. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce the burden on your Ummah.' I said, `I have asked my Lord until I feel too shy. I accept this and submit to Him.' Then a voice called out: `My order has been decreed and I have reduced the burden on My servants.') Similar narrations were recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p><h2>The Report of Anas from Abu Dharr</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said: Abu Dharr used to tell us that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«فُرِجَ عَنْ سَقْفِ بَيْتِي وَأَنَا بِمَكَّةَ، فَنَزَلَ جِبْرِيلُ فَفَرَجَ صَدْرِي ثُمَّ غَسَلَهُ بِمَاءِ زَمْزَمَ، ثُمَّ جَاءَ بِطَسْتٍ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ مُمْتَلِىءٍ حِكْمَةً وَإِيمَانًا، فَأَفْرَغَهُ فِي صَدْرِي، ثُمَّ أَطْبَقَهُ ثُمَّ أَخَذَ بِيَدِي فَعَرَجَ بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا، فَلَمَّا جِئْتُ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ لِخَازِنِ السَّمَاءِ: افْتَحْ قَالَ: مَنْ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: جِبْرِيلُ، قَالَ: هَلْ مَعَكَ أَحَدٌ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ مَعِيَ مُحَمَّدٌصلى الله عليه وسلّم، فَقَالَ: أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ فَلَمَّا فَتَحَ عَلَوْنَا السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا فَإِذَا رَجُلٌ قَاعِدٌ عَلَى يَمِينِهِ أَسْوِدَةٌ وَعَلَى يَسَارِهِ أَسْوِدَةٌ، إِذَا نَظَرَ قِبَلَ يَمِينِهِ ضَحِكَ وَإِذَا نَظَرَ قِبَلَ شِمَالِهِ بَكَى، فَقَالَ: مَرْحَبًا بِالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ وَالْابْنِ الصَّالِحِ قَالَ قُلْتُ لِجِبْرِيلَ: مَنْ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: هَذَا آدَمُ وَهَذِهِ الْأَسْوِدَةُ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ وَعَنْ شِمَالِهِ نَسَمُ بَنِيهِ، فَأَهْلُ الْيَمِينِ مِنْهُمْ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَالْأَسْوِدَةُ الَّتِي عَنْ شِمَالِهِ أَهْلُ النَّارِ، فَإِذَا نَظَرَ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ ضَحِكَ، وَإِذَا نَظَرَ عَنْ شِمَالِهِ بَكَى، ثُمَّ عَرَجَ بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الثَّانِيَة»</p><p>فذكر الحديث قال:</p><p>«ثُمَّ مَرَرْتُ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ فَقَالَ: مَرْحبًا بِالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ وَالْابْنِ الصَّالِحِ، قُلْتُ: مَنْ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: هَذَا إِبْرَاهِيم»</p><p>(The roof of my house was opened while I was in Makkah, and Jibril came down and opened my chest, then he washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a vessel of gold filled with wisdom and faith, and poured it into my chest, then he closed it up. Then he took me by the hand and took me up to the lowest heaven. When we came to the lowest heaven, Jibril said to its keeper, `Open up!' He said, `Who is this' He said, `Jibril. ' He said, `Is there anyone with you' He said, `Yes, Muhammad is with me.' He said, `Has his Mission started' He said, `Yes.' When it was opened, we went up into the first heaven, where I saw a man sitting with a multitude to his right and another to his left. When he looked to his right he smiled, and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said, `Welcome to the righteous Prophet and the righteous son.' I said to Jibril, `Who is this' He said, `This is Adam, and these multitudes to his right and left are the souls of his descendants. The people on his right include the people of Paradise, and the people on his left include the people of Hell, so when he looks to his right he smiles, and when he looks to his left he weeps.' Then he took me up to the second heaven...Then we passed by Ibrahim, who said, `Welcome to the righteous Prophet and the righteous son.' I said, `Who is this' He said, `This is Ibrahim.') Az-Zuhri said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn `Abbas and Abu Habbah Al-Ansari used to say: the Prophet narrated here -</p><p>«ثُمَّ عُرِجَ بِي حَتَّى ظَهَرْتُ لِمُسْتَوًى أَسْمَعُ فِيهِ صَرِيفَ الْأَقْلَام»</p><p>(Then I was taken up until I reached a level where I could hear the sound of the pens.) Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«فَفَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَى أُمَّتِي خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً، فَرَجَعْتُ بِذَلِكَ حَتَّى مَرَرْتُ عَلَى مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، فَقَالَ: مَا فَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَى أُمَّتِكَ؟ قُلْتُ: فَرَضَ خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً، قَالَ مُوسَى: فَارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ، فَرَجَعْتُ فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا، فَرَجَعْتُ إِلَى مُوسَى، قُلْتُ: وَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا، فَقَالَ: ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ، فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ، فَرَجَعْتُ فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا، فَرَجَعْتُ إِلَىْهِ فَقَالَ:ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ، فَرَاجَعْتُهُ فَقَالَ: هِيَ خَمْسٌ وَهِيَ خَمْسُونَ لَا يُبَدَّلُ الْقَوْلُ لَدَيَّ، فَرَجَعْتُ إِلَى مُوسَى فَقَالَ: ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ، قُلْتُ: قَدِ اسْتَحْيَيْتُ مِنْ رَبِّي، ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ بِي حَتَّى انْتَهَى إِلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى فَغَشِيَهَا أَلْوَانٌ لَا أَدْرِي مَااِهيَ، ثُمَّ أُدْخِلْتُ الْجَنَّةَ، فَإِذَا فِيهَا حَبَائِلُ اللُّؤْلُؤِ، وَإِذَا تُرَابُهَا الْمِسْك»</p><p>(Allah enjoined upon my Ummah fifty prayers. I came back with this (message) until I passed by Musa, who said, `What did your Lord enjoin upon your Ummah' I said, `He enjoined fifty prayers.' Musa said, `Go back to your Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back, and He reduced it by half. Then I came back to Musa and said, `It has been reduced by half.' He said, `Go back to your Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back, and it was reduced by half. I came back to him, and he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to do that.' So I went back, and He said: `They are five but equal in reward to fifty, for My word does not change.' I came back to Musa and he said, `Go back to your Lord.' I said, `I feel too shy before my Lord.' Then I was taken up until I reached Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which was veiled in indescribable colors. Then I entered Paradise, in which I saw nets of pearls and its soil of musk.) This version was recorded by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Prayer. He also reported in the Book of Tafsir, under the discussion of Bani Isra'il (i.e., Surat Al-Isra'), the Book of Hajj and the Stories of the Prophets, via different chains of narration from Yunus. Muslim recorded similar Hadiths in his Sahih in the Book of Faith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Shaqiq said: I said to Abu Dharr, ""If I had seen the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I would have asked him."" He said, ""What would you have asked him"" He said, ""I would have asked him, if he saw his Lord"" He said, ""I did ask him that, and he said,</p><p>«قَدْ رَأَيْتُهُ نُورًا، أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(I saw it as light, how could I see Him)"" This is how it was narrated in the report of Imam Ahmad. Muslim recorded that `Abdullah bin Shaqiq said that Abu Dharr said: ""I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Did you see your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>((I saw) a light, how could I see Him)"" `Abdullah bin Shaqiq said: I said to Abu Dharr, ""If I had seen the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I would have asked him."" He said, ""What would you have asked him"" He said, ""I would have asked him, `Did you see your Lord"" Abu Dharr said, ""I asked him that, and he said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I saw light.)</p><h2>The Report of Jabir bin `Abdullah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p>«لَمَّا كَذَّبَتْنِي قُرَيْشٌ حِينَ أُسْرِيَ بِي إِلَى بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِسِ، قُمْتُ فِي الْحِجْرِ فَجَلَى اللهُ لِي بَيْتَ الْمَقْدِسِ، فَطَفِقْتُ أُخْبِرُهُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِهِ وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْه»</p><p>(When Quraysh did not believe that I had been taken on the Night Journey to Bayt Al-Maqdis, I stood up in Al-Hijr and Allah displayed Bayt Al-Maqdis before me, so I told them about its features while I was looking at it.) This was also reported in the Two Sahihs with different chains of narration. According to Al-Bayhaqi, Ibn Shihab said: Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman said: Some people from Quraish went to Abu Bakr and said, ""Have you heard what your companion is saying He is claiming that he went to Bayt Al-Maqdis and came back to Makkah in one night!"" Abu Bakr said, ""Did he say that"" They said, ""Yes."" Abu Bakr said, ""Then I bear witness that if he said that, he is speaking the truth."" They said, ""You believe that he went to Ash-Sham Greater Syria in one night and came back to Makkah before morning"" He said, ""Yes, I believe him with regard to something even more than that. I believe him with regard to the revelation that comes to him from heaven."" Abu Salamah said, from then on Abu Bakr was known as As-Siddiq (the true believer).</p><h2>The Report of `Abdullah bin `Abbas</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: ""On the night when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on his Night Journey, he entered Paradise, in some part of which he heard a sound. He said, `O Jibril, what is this' He said, `This is Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin.' When the Prophet came back to the people, he said,</p><p>«قَدْ أَفْلَحَ بِلَالٌ، رَأَيْتُ لَهُ كَذَا وَكَذَا»</p><p>(Bilal has succeeded, I saw that he will have such and such.) He the Prophet was met by Musa, who welcomed him and said, `Welcome to the Unlettered Prophet.' He was a tall, dark man with lank hair coming down to his ears or above his ears. He said, `Who is this, O Jibril' He said, `This is Musa.' Then he went on and met a venerable, distinguished old man, who welcomed him and greeted him with Salam, and all of them were greeting him. He said, `Who is this, O Jibril' He said, `This is your father Ibrahim.' Then he looked into Hell and saw some people eating rotten meat. He said, `Who are these people, O Jibril' He said, `They are those who used to eat the flesh of the people i.e., backbiting.' He saw a man who was very red and dark blue, and said, `Who is this, O Jibril' He said, `This is the one who slaughtered the she-camel (of Salih).' When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, he stood up to pray, and all the Prophets gathered and prayed with him. When he finished, he was brought two cups, one on his right and one on his left, one containing milk and one containing honey. He took the milk and drank it, and the one who was carrying the cup said, `You have chosen the Fitrah (natural instinct).""' The chain of narrators is Sahih, although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it. Imam Ahmad reported that Ibn `Abbas said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Night Journey to Bayt Al-Maqdis, then he came back and told them about his journey and the features of Bayt Al-Maqdis and the caravan (of Quraysh). Some people said, `We do not believe what Muhammad is saying,' and they left Islam and became disbelievers. Allah destroyed them when He destroyed Abu Jahl. Abu Jahl said: `Muhammad is trying to scare us with the tree of Zaqqum; bring some dates and butter and let us have some Zaqqum!' The Prophet also saw the Dajjal in his true form, in real life, not in a dream, and he saw `Isa, Musa and Ibrahim. The Prophet was asked about the Dajjal, and he said:</p><p>«رَأَيْتُهُ فَيلَمَانِيًا أَقْمَرَ هِجَانًا، إِحْدَى عَيْنَيْهِ قَائِمَةٌ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّيٌّ، كَأَنَّ شَعْرَ رَأْسِهِ أَغْصَانُ شَجَرَةٍ، وَرَأَيْتُ عِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ (شابًّا) أَبْيَضَ، جَعْدَ الرَّأْسِ حَدِيدَ الْبَصَرِ، وَمُبَطَّنَ الْخَلْقِ، وَرَأَيْتُ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ أَسْحَمَ آدَمَ، كَثِيرَ الشَّعْرِ، شَدِيدَ الْخَلْقِ، وَنَظَرْتُ إِلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ فَلَمْ أَنْظُرْ إِلَى إِرْبٍ مِنْهُ إِلَّا نَظَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ مِنِّي حَتَّى كَأَنَّهُ صَاحِبُكُمْ، قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ: سَلِّمْ عَلَى أَبِيكَ، فَسَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْه»</p><p>(I saw him as a tall and huge man, with a whitish complexion. One of his eyes stood out like a shining star. The hair on his head looked like the branches of a tree. And I saw `Isa, white with curly hair and an intense gaze, of average build. I saw Musa, dark-skinned, with a lot of hair and a strong build. I looked at Ibrahim and did not see anything in him that I do not see in myself; it is as if he were your companion meaning himself. Jibril said: `Greet your father with Salam,' so I greeted him with Salam.) This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i from the Hadith of Abu Zayd Thabit bin Yazid from Hilal, who is Ibn Khabbab, and it is a Sahih chain of narrators. Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Abu Al-`Aliyah said: ""The cousin of your Prophet , Ibn `Abbas narrated to us from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he said: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي مُوسَى بْنَ عِمْرَانَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا جَعْدًا، كَأَنَّهُ مِنْ رِجَالِ شَنُوءَةَ، وَرَأَيْتُ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ مَرْبُوعَ الْخَلْقِ إِلَى الْحُمْرَةِ وَالْبَيَاضِ سَبْطَ الرَّأس»</p><p>(On the night when I was taken on the Night Journey, I saw Musa bin `Imran, a tall, curly-haired man, as if he was from the tribe of Shanu'ah. And I saw `Isa bin Maryam, of medium stature, white with a reddish complexion, with straight hair.) And he was shown Malik, the keeper of Hell, and the Dajjal, with the signs that Allah revealed to him.' He said,</p><p>فَلاَ تَكُن فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآئِهِ</p><p>(So be not you in doubt of meeting him.) 32:33 Qatadah used to interpret this to mean that the Prophet of Allah met Musa.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَاهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(And We made it or him a guide to the Children of Israel) 32:33 Qatadah said: ""(This means) Allah made Musa a guide for the Children of Israel. "" Muslim reported this in his Sahih, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded a shorter version from Qatadah. Imam Ahmad also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَمَّا كَانَ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي، فَأَصْبَحْتُ بِمَكَّةَ فَظِعْتُ وَعَرَفْتُ أَنَّ النَّاسَ مُكَذِّبِي»</p><p>(On the night when I was taken on the Night Journey, I woke up in Makkah the next morning having anxiety that, I knew that the people would not believe me.) He kept away from people, feeling anxious and sad, then the enemy of Allah Abu Jahl passed by him and came to sit with him, saying mockingly, `Is there anything new' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نَعَم»</p><p>(Yes). He said, `What is it' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي أُسْرِيَ بِي اللَّيْلَة»</p><p>(I was taken on a Journey last night.) He said, `Where to' He said,</p><p>«إِلَى بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِس»</p><p>(To Bayt Al-Maqdis.) He said, `Then this morning you were among us' He said,</p><p>«نَعَم»</p><p>(Yes). Abu Jahl did not want to say to his face that he was lying, lest he deny saying it when he called other people to hear him, so he said: `Do you think that if I call your people, you will tell them about what happened' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نَعَم»</p><p>(Yes.) Abu Jahl said, `O people of Bani Ka`b bin Lu'ay!' People got up from where they were sitting and came to join them. Abu Jahl said, `Tell your people what you told me.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنِّي أُسْرِيَ بِي اللَّيْلَة»</p><p>(I was taken on a Journey last night.) They said, `Where to' He said,</p><p>«إِلَى بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِس»</p><p>(To Bayt Al-Maqdis.) They said, `Then this morning you were among us' He said,</p><p>«نَعَم»</p><p>(Yes). They began to clap their hands together and put their hands on their heads in astonishment at this ""lie"" - as they claimed it to be. They said, `Can you describe the sanctuary to us' Among them were some who had travelled to that land and seen the sanctuary, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَمَا زِلْتُ أَنْعَتُ حَتَّى الْتَبَسَ عَلَيَّ بَعْضُ النَّعْتِ قَالَ فَجِيءَ بِالْمَسْجِدِ وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى وُضِعَ دُونَ دَارِ عُقَيلٍ أَوْ عِقَالٍ فَنَعَتُّهُ وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِ قَالَ وَكَانَ مَعَ هَذَا نَعْتٌ لَمْ أَحْفَظْهُ قَالَ فَقَالَ الْقَوْمُ: أَمَّا النَّعْتُ فَوَاللهِ لَقَدْ أَصَابَ فِيه»</p><p>(I started to describe it, until I reached a point where I was not sure about some of the details, but then the sanctuary was brought close and placed near the house of `Uqayl - or `Iqal - so I could look at it and describe the details.) I could not remember those description. The people said, `As for the description, by Allah he has got it right."" This was recorded by An-Nasa'i and Al-Bayhaqi.</p><h2>The Report of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud</h2><p>Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi reported that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said: ""When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Night Journey, he went as far as Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the sixth heaven. Everything that ascends stops there, until it is taken from that point, and everything that comes down stops there, until it is taken from there.</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered As-Sidrat Al-Muntaha which did cover it!) 53:16 Ibn Mas`ud said: ""It is covered with gold butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given the five prayers and the final Ayat of Surat Al-Baqarah, and forgiveness was granted for major sins to those who do not associate anything in worship with Allah."" This was recorded by Muslim in his Sahih.</p><h2>The Report of Abu Hurayrah</h2><p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in their Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«حِينَ أُسْرِيَ بِي، لَقِيتُ مُوسَى عَلَيهِ السَّلَامُ فَنَعَتَهُ، فَإِذَا رَجُلٌ حَسِبْتُهُ قَالَ مُضْطَرِبٌ رَجِلُ الرَّأْسِ كَأَنَّهُ مِنْ رِجَالِ شَنُوءَةَ، قَالَ: وَلَقِيتُ عِيسَى فَنَعَتَهُ النَّبِيُّصلى الله عليه وسلّم قَالَ رَبْعَةٌ أَحْمَرُ كَأَنَّمَا خَرَجَ مِنْ دِيمَاسٍ يَعْنِي حَمَّامًا، قَالَ وَلَقِيتُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَأَنَا أَشْبَهُ وَلَدِهِ بِهِ، قَالَ: وَأُتِيتُ بِإِنَاءَيْنِ فِي أَحَدِهِمَا لَبَنٌ وَفِي الْآخَرِ خَمْرٌ، قِيلَ لِي: خُذْ أَيَّهُمَا شِئْتَ، فَأَخَذْتُ اللَّبَنَ فَشَرِبْتُ، فَقِيلَ لِي: هُدِيتَ الْفِطْرَةَ أَوْ أَصَبْتَ الْفِطْرَةَ أَمَا إِنَّكَ لَوْ أَخَذْتَ الْخَمْرَ غَوَتْ أُمَّتُك»</p><p>(When I was taken on the Night Journey, I met Musa.) He described him as a man - I think he said - a curly-haired man, as if he were from the tribe of Shanu'ah. (And I met `Isa.) And the Prophet described him as being of average height, with a reddish complexion, as if he had just come out of the bath. (And I met Ibrahim, and I am the one who resembles him most among his children. I was brought two vessels, one containing milk and the other containing wine. It was said to me, `Take whichever one you want.' So I took the milk and drank it, and it was said to me, `You have been guided to the Fitrah - or - You have chosen the Fitrah. If you had chosen the wine, your Ummah would have gone astray.')"" They also recorded it with another chain of narrators. Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَقَدْ رَأَيْتُنِي فِي الْحِجْرِ وَقُرَيْشٌ تَسْأَلُنِي عَنْ مَسْرَايَ،فَسَأَلُونِي عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ مِنْ بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِسِ لَمْ أُثْبِتْهَا، فَكُرِبْتُ (كُرْبَةً) مَا كُرِبْتُ مِثْلَهُ قَطُّ، فَرَفَعَهُ اللهُ إِليَّ أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِ مَا سَأَلُونِي عَنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا أَنْبَأْتُهُمْ بِهِ، وَقَدْ رَأَيْتُنِي فِي جَمَاعَةٍ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ، وَإِذَا مُوسَى قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّي، وَإِذَا هُوَ رَجُلٌ جَعْدٌ كَأَنَّهُ مِنْ رِجَالِ شَنُوءَةَ، وَإِذَا عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّي أَقْرَبُ النَّاسِ شَبَهًا بِهِ عَرْوَةُ بْنُ مَسْعُودٍ الثَّقَفِيُّ، وَإِذَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّي أَقْرَبُ النَّاسِ شَبَهًا بِهِ صَاحِبُكُمْ يَعْنِي نَفْسَهُ فَحَانَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَأَمَمْتُهُمْ، فَلَمَّا فَرَغْتُ قَالَ قَائِلٌ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ هَذَا مَالِكُ خَازِنُ جَهَنَّمَ، (فَسَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِ) فَالْتَفَتُّ إِلَيْهِ فَبَدَأَنِي بِالسَّلَام»</p><p>(I remember being in Al-Hijr, and the Quraysh were asking me about my Night Journey. They asked me things about Bayt Al-Maqdis that I was not sure of, and I felt more anxious and stressed then than I have ever felt. Then Allah raised up Bayt Al-Maqdis for me to see, and there was nothing they asked me about but I told them about it. And I remember being in a gathering of the Prophets. Musa was standing there praying, and he was a man with curly hair, as if he were one of the men of Shanu'ah. I saw `Isa bin Maryam standing there praying, and the one who most resembles him is `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. And I saw Ibrahim standing there praying, and the one who most resembles him is your companion (meaning himself). Then the time for prayer came, and I led them in prayer. When I finished, a voice said, `O Muhammad, this is Malik, the keeper of Hell,' so I turned to him, and he greeted me first.)""</p><h2>The Time that Isra' took place, and the Fact that it included both Body and Soul, when the ...</h2><p>Musa bin `Uqbah said, narrating from Az-Zuhri: ""The Isra' happened one year before the Hijrah."" This was also the opinion of `Urwah. As-Suddi said: ""It happened sixteen months before the Hijrah."" The truth is that the Prophet was taken on the Night Journey when he was awake, not in a dream, and he went from Makkah to Bayt Al-Maqdis riding on Al-Buraq. When he reached the door of the sanctuary, he tied up his animal by the door and entered, where he prayed two Rak`ahs to `greet the Masjid'. Then the Mi`raj was brought to him, which is a ladder with steps which one climbs up. So he went up on it to the first heaven, then he went up to the rest of the seven heavens. In each heaven he was welcomed by the most pious of its inhabitants, and he greeted the Prophets who were in the various heavens according to their positions and status. He passed by Musa, the one who spoke with Allah, in the sixth heaven, and Ibrahim, the close friend (Khalil) of Allah in the seventh heaven. Then he surpassed them and all the Prophets in status and reached a level where he could hear the creaking of the pens, i.e., the pens of destiny which write down what is decreed to happen. He saw Sidrat Al-Muntaha, covered by the command of Allah, and its greatness, its butterflies of gold and various colours, surrounded by the angels. There he saw Jibril in his real form, with six hundred wings. He saw green cushions blocking the horizon. He saw Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur, and Ibrahim Al-Khalil, the builder of the earthly Ka`bah, leaning back against it, the heavenly Ka`bah; every day, seventy thousand angels enter and worship therein, then they do not return to it until the Day of Resurrection. He saw Paradise and Hell, and Allah enjoined upon him fifty prayers, then reduced it to five, as an act of mercy and kindness towards His servants. In this is a strong indication of the greatness and virtue of the prayers. Then he came back down to Bayt Al-Maqdis, and the Prophets came down with him and he led them in prayer there when the time for prayer came. It may have been the dawn prayer of that day. Some people claim that he led them in prayer in heaven, but the reports seem to say that it was in Bayt Al-Maqdis. In some reports it says that it happened when he first entered (i.e., before ascending into the heavens), but it is more likely that it was after he came back, because when he passed by them in the places in the heavens, he asked Jibril about them, one by one, and Jibril told him about them. This is more appropriate, because he was first required to come before the Divine Presence, so that what Allah willed could be enjoined upon him and his Ummah. When the matter for which he was required had been dealt with, he and his brother-Prophets gathered, and his virtue and high position in relation to them became apparent when he was asked to come forward to lead them, which was when Jibril indicated to him that he should do so. Then he came out of Bayt Al-Maqdis and rode on Al-Buraq back to Makkah in the darkness of the night. And Allah knows best. As for his being presented with the vessels containing milk and honey, or milk and wine, or milk and water, or all of these, some reports say that this happened in Bayt Al-Maqdis, and others say that it happened in the heavens. It is possible that it happened in both places, because it is like offering food or drink to a guest when he arrives, and Allah knows best. The Prophet was taken on the Night Journey with body and soul, he was awake, not asleep. The evidence for this is the Ayah:</p><p>سُبْحَانَ الَّذِى أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الاٌّقْصَى الَّذِى بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ</p><p>(Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) Who took His servant for a Journey by Night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, the neighborhood whereof We have blessed,) The words ""Subhan Allah"" (Glorified and exalted be Allah) are spoken in the case of serious matters. If it had been a dream, it would have been a significant matter and would not have been so astounding; the disbelievers of the Quraysh would not have hastened to label him a liar and the group of people who had become Muslims would not have deserted the faith. The word `Abd (servant) refers to both soul and body. Allah says:</p><p>أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً</p><p>(took His servant for a Journey by Night) and:</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّءْيَا الَّتِى أَرَيْنَـكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ</p><p>(And We made not the vision which we showed you but a trial for mankind) 17:60 Ibn `Abbas said: ""This is the vision that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw with his own eyes during the Journey by Night, and the cursed tree is the tree of Zaqqum."" This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Allah said:</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight (of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) turned not aside (right or left), nor it transgressed beyond the limit (ordained for it))(53:17) Sight (Al-Basr) is a physical faculty, not a spiritual one, and he was carried on Al-Buraq, a shining white animal. This too indicates a physical journey, because the soul does not need a means of transportation of this nature. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>An Interesting Story</h2><p>In his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, Al-Hafiz Abu Nu`aym Al-Isbahani recorded via Muhammad bin `Umar Al-Waqidi who said: Malik bin Abi Ar-Rijjal told me from `Amr bin `Abdullah that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Dihyah bin Khalifah to Caesar."" He mentioned how he came to him, and described an incident that showed how wise Caesar was. He sent for the Arab merchants who were in Syria and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and his companions were brought to him. He asked them the well-known questions that were recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, as we shall discuss below, and Abu Sufyan tried hard to give the impression that this was an insignificant issue. The narrator said that Abu Sufyan later said: ""By Allah, nothing stopped me from saying something to Heraclius to make him despise Muhammad but the fact that I did not want to tell a lie that would later be found out, and he would never believe me again after that. Then I told him about the night on which he was taken on the Night Journey. I said: `O King, shall I not tell you of something from which you will know that he is lying' He said, `What is it' I said: `He claims that he went out of our land, the land of Al-Haram, in one night, and came to your sanctuary in Jerusalem, then came back to us the same night, before morning came.' The Patriarch of Jerusalem was there, standing next to Caesar. The Patriarch of Jerusalem said: `I know that night.' Caesar looked at him and said, `How do you know about this' He said, `I never used to sleep at night until I closed the doors of the sanctuary. On that night I closed all the doors except for one, which I could not manage to close. I asked my workers and others who were with me to help me deal with it, but we could not move it. It was like trying to move a mountain. So I called the carpenters, and they looked at it and said: The lintel and some part of the structure has fallen onto it. We cannot move it until morning, when we will be able to see what the problem is. So I went back and left those two doors open. The next morning I went back, and saw that the stone at the corner of the sanctuary had a hole in it, and there were traces of an animal having been tethered there. I said to my companions: This door has not been closed last night except for a Prophet, who prayed last night in our sanctuary.""' And he mentioned the rest of the Hadith. In his book At-Tanwir fi Mawlid As-Siraj Al-Munir, Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Khattab `Umar bin Dihyah mentioned the Hadith of the Isra' narrated from Anas, and spoke well about it, then he said: ""The reports of the Hadith of the Isra' reach the level of Mutawatir. They were narrated from `Umar bin Al-Khattab, `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Abu Dharr, Malik bin Sa`sa`ah, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa`id, Ibn `Abbas, Shaddad bin Aws, Ubayy bin Ka`b, `Abdur-Rahman bin Qarat, Abu Habbah Al-Ansari, Abu Layla Al-Ansari, `Abdullah bin `Amr, Jabir, Hudhayfah, Buraydah, Abu Ayyub, Abu Umamah, Samurah bin Jundub, Abu Al-Hamra', Suhayb Ar-Rumi, Umm Hani', and `A'ishah and `Asma', the daughters of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with them all. Some of them narrated the incident at length, and others narrated it more briefly, as was reported in the Musnad collections. Even though some reports do not fulfill the conditions of Sahih, nevertheless the Muslims agreed unanimously on the fact that the Isra' happened, and it was rejected only by the heretics and apostates.</p><p>يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِئُواْ نُورَ اللَّهِ بِأَفْوَهِهِمْ وَاللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(They intend to put out the Light of Allah with their mouths. But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it).) (61:8).</p>"
2031,"<h2>Musa and how He was given the Tawrah</h2><p>When Allah mentions how He took His servant Muhammad ﷺ, on the Journey by Night, He follows it by mentioning Musa, His servant and Messenger who also spoke with Him. Allah often mentions Muhammad ﷺ and Musa (AH.) together, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both, and he mentions the Tawrah and the Qur'an together. So after mentioning the Isra', He says:</p><p>وَءَاتَيْنَآ مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ</p><p>(And We gave Musa the Scripture), meaning the Tawrah.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَاهُ</p><p>(and made it), meaning the Scripture,</p><p>هُدًى</p><p>(a guidance), meaning a guide,</p><p>لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ أَلاَّ تَتَّخِذُواْ</p><p>(for the Children of Israel (saying): ""Take none..."") means, lest they should take,</p><p>مِن دُونِى وَكِيلاً</p><p>(""... other than Me as (your) Wakil"") means, `you have no protector, supporter or god besides Me,' because Allah revealed to every Prophet that he should worship Him alone with no partner or associate. Then Allah says:</p><p>ذُرِّيَّةَ مَنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ</p><p>(O offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh) by addressing the descendants of those who were carried in the ship with Nuh there is a reminder of the blessings, as if Allah is saying: `O descendants of those whom We saved and carried in the ship with Nuh, follow in the footsteps of your father,</p><p>إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَبْدًا شَكُورًا</p><p>(Verily, he was a grateful servant). `Remember the blessing I have granted you by sending Muhammad ﷺ.' Imam Ahmad reported that Anas bin Malik said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْضَى عَنِ الْعَبْدِ أَنْ يَأْكُلَ الْأَكْلَةَ أَوْ يَشْرَبَ الشَّرْبَةَ فَيَحْمَدَ اللهَ عَلَيْهَا»</p><p>(Allah will be pleased with His servant if, when he eats something or drinks something, he praises Allah for it.)"" This was also recorded by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Malik said about Zayd bin Aslam: ""He used to praise Allah in all circumstances."" In this context, Al-Bukhari mentioned the Hadith of Abu Zar`ah narrating from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet said:</p><p>«أَنَا سَيِّدُ وَلَدِ آدَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(I will be the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Resurrection...) He quoted the Hadith at length, and in the Hadith, the Prophet said:</p><p>«فَيَأْتُونَ نُوحًا فَيَقُولُونَ: يَا نُوحُ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ أَوَّلُ الرُّسُلِ إِلَى أَهْلِ الْأَرْضِ، وَقَدْ سَمَّاكَ اللهُ عَبْدًا شَكُورًا، فَاشْفَعْ لَنَا إِلَى رَبِّك»</p><p>(They will come to Nuh and will say, `O Nuh, you were the first of the Messengers sent to the people of earth, and Allah called you grateful servant, so intercede for us with your Lord.') And he quoted the Hadith in full.</p>"

2033,"<h2>It was mentioned in the Tawrah that the Jews would spread Mischief twice</h2><p>Allah tells us that He made a declaration to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, meaning that He had already told them in the Book which He revealed to them, that they would cause mischief on the earth twice, and would become tyrants and extremely arrogant, meaning they would become shameless oppressors of people, Allah says:</p><p>وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ ذَلِكَ الاٌّمْرَ أَنَّ دَابِرَ هَـؤُلآْءِ مَقْطُوعٌ مُّصْبِحِينَ</p><p>(And We made known this decree to him, that the root of those (sinners) was to be cut off in the early morning.)(15:66), meaning, We already told him about that and informed him of it.</p><h2>The First Episode of Mischief caused by the Jews, and their Punishment for it</h2><p>فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ أُولَـهُمَا</p><p>(So, when the promise came for the first of the two) meaning the first of the two episodes of mischief.</p><p>بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَآ أُوْلِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ</p><p>(We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare.) means, `We unleashed soldiers against you from among Our creatures who were given to terrible warfare,' i.e., they had great strength and weapons and power. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes, meaning they took possession of your land and invaded the very innermost parts of your homes, going between and through your houses, coming and going freely with no fear of anyone. This was the promise (completely) fulfilled. The earlier and later commentators differed over the identity of these invaders. Many Isra'iliyyat (reports from Jewish sources) were narrated about this, but I did not want to make this book too long by mentioning them, because some of them are fabricated, concocted by their heretics, and others may be true, but we have no need of them, praise be to Allah. What Allah has told us in His Book (the Qur'an) is sufficient and we have no need of what is in the other books that came before. Neither Allah nor His Messenger required us to refer to them. Allah told His Messenger that when (the Jews) committed transgression and aggression, Allah gave their enemies power over them to destroy their country and enter the innermost parts of their homes. Their humiliation and subjugation was a befitting punishment, and your Lord is never unfair or unjust to His servants. They had rebelled and killed many of the Prophets and scholars. Ibn Jarir recorded that Yahya bin Sa`id said: ""I heard Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib saying: `Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ash-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine), destroying Jerusalem and killing them, then he came to Damascus and found blood boiling in a censer. He asked them: What is this blood They said: We found our forefathers doing this. Because of that blood, he killed seventy thousand of the believers and others, then the blood stopped boiling. This report is Sahih from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, and this event is well-known, as he (Nebuchadnezzar) killed their nobles and scholars, and did not leave alive anyone who knew the Tawrah by heart. He took many prisoners from the sons of the Prophets and others, and did many other things that would take too long to mention here. If we had found anything that was correct or close enough, we could have written it and reported it here. And Allah knows best. Then Allah says:</p><p>إِنْ أَحْسَنتُمْ أَحْسَنتُمْ لاًّنفُسِكُمْ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَا</p><p>((And We said): ""If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves."") As Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا</p><p>(Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself.) 45:15</p><h2>The Second Episode of Mischief</h2><p>Then Allah says:</p><p>فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ الاٌّخِرَةِ</p><p>(Then, when the second promise came to pass,) meaning, the second episode of mischief, when your enemies came again,</p><p>لِيَسُوءُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ</p><p>((We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces) meaning, to humiliate you and subdue you,</p><p>وَلِيَدْخُلُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ</p><p>(and to enter the Masjid) meaning, Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).</p><p>كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ</p><p>(as they had entered it before,) when they entered the very innermost parts of your homes.</p><p>وَلِيُتَبِّرُواْ</p><p>(and to destroy) wrecking and inflicting ruin upon it.</p><p>مَا عَلَوْاْ</p><p>(all that fell in their hands.) everything they could get their hands on.</p><p>تَتْبِيرًاعَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَن يَرْحَمَكُمْ</p><p>(with utter destruction. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you) meaning that He may rid you of them.</p><p>وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا</p><p>(but if you return (to sins), We shall return (to Our punishment).) meaning, if you return to causing mischief,</p><p>عُدْنَا</p><p>(We shall return) means, We `will once again punish you in this world, along with the punishment and torment We save for you in the Hereafter.'</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ حَصِيرًا</p><p>(And We have made Hell a prison Hasir for the disbelievers.) meaning, a place of permanent detention, a prison which cannot be avoided or escaped. Ibn `Abbas said, ""Hasir here means a jail."" Mujahid said, ""They will be detained in it."" Others said like- wise. Al-Hasan said, ""Hasir means a bed of Fire."" Qatadah said: ""The Children of Israel returned to aggres- sion, so Allah sent this group against them, Muhammad ﷺ and his companions, who made them pay the Jizyah, with willing submission, and feeling themselves subdued.""</p>"

2141,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>What has been mentioned about the Virtues of this Surah and the first and last ten Ayat</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Bara' said: ""A man recited Al-Kahf and there was an animal in the house which began acting in a nervous manner. He looked, and saw a fog or cloud overhead. He mentioned this to the Prophet , who said:</p><p>«اقْرَأْ فُلَانُ، فَإِنَّهَا السَّكِينَةُ تَنْزِلُ عِنْدَ الْقُرْآنِ أَوْ تَنَزَّلَتْ لِلْقُرْآن»</p><p>(Keep on reciting so and so, for this is the tranquillity which descends when one reads Qur'an or because of reading Qur'an;) This was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. This man who recited it was Usayd bin Al-Hudayr, as we have previously mentioned in our Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Ad-Darda' that the Prophet said:</p><p>«مَنْ حَفِظَ عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ مِنْ أَوَّلِ سُورَةِ الْكَهْفِ عُصِمَ مِنَ الدَّجَّال»</p><p>(Whoever memorizes ten Ayat from the beginning of Surat Al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal.) This was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and At-Tirmidhi. According to the version recorded by At-Tirmidhi,</p><p>«مَنْ حَفِظَ ثَلَاثَ آيَاتٍ مِنْ أَوَّلِ الْكَهْف»</p><p>(Whoever memorizes three Ayat from the beginning of Al-Kahf.) He said, it is ""Hasan Sahih. "" In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Prophet said:</p><p>«مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ فِي يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ أَضَاءَ لَهُ مِنَ النُّورِ مَا بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجُمُعَتَيْن»</p><p>(Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf on Friday, it will illuminate him with light from one Friday to the next.) Then he said: ""This Hadith has a Sahih chain, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it."" Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi also recorded it in his Sunan from Al-Hakim, then he narrated with his own chain that the Prophet said:</p><p>«مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ كَمَا نَزَلَتْ، كَانَتْ لَهُ نُورًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf as it was revealed, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection.)</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Revelation of the Qur'an brings both Good News and a Warning</h2><p>In the beginning of this Tafsir, we mentioned that Allah, praises His Holy Self at the beginning and end of matters, for He is the One to be praised in all circumstances, all praise and thanks be to Him, in the beginning and in the end. He praises Himself for revealing His Mighty Book to His Noble Messenger Muhammad ﷺ, which is the greatest blessing that Allah has granted the people of this earth. Through the Qur'an, He brings them out of the darkness into light. He has made it a Book that is straight, neither distorted nor confusion therein. It clearly guides to a straight path, plain and manifest, giving a warning to the disbelievers and good news to the believers. This is why Allah says:</p><p>وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُ عِوَجَا</p><p>(and has not placed therein any crookedness.) meaning, there is nothing twisted or confusing about it. But He has made it balanced and straightforward as He said;</p><p>قَيِّماً</p><p>((He has made it) straight), meaning straightforward,</p><p>لِّيُنْذِرَ بَأْسًا شَدِيدًا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ</p><p>(to give warning of a severe punishment from Him,) meaning, to those who oppose His Prophet and disbelieve in His Book, He issues a warning of severe punishment hastened in this world and postponed to the world Hereafter.</p><p>مِن لَّدُنْهُ</p><p>(from Him) means, from Allah. For none can punish as He punishes and none is stronger or more reliable than Him.</p><p>وَيُبَشِّرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(and to give good news to the believers,) means, those who believe in this Qur'an and confirm their faith by righteous actions.</p><p>أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(that they shall have a fair reward.) means, a beautiful reward from Allah.</p><p>مَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ</p><p>(They shall abide therein) means, in what Allah rewards them with, and that is Paradise, where they will live forever.</p><p>أَبَدًا</p><p>(forever.) means, for always, never ending or ceasing to be.</p><p>وَيُنْذِرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ وَلَدًا</p><p>(And to warn those who say, ""Allah has begotten a child."") Ibn Ishaq said: ""These are the pagan Arabs, who said, `We worship the angels who are the daughters of Allah.""'</p><p>مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(No knowledge have they of such a thing, ) meaning, this thing that they have fabricated and made up.</p><p>وَلاَ لاَبَآئِهِمْ</p><p>(nor had their fathers.) meaning, their predecessors.</p><p>كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً</p><p>(Mighty is the word) This highlights the seriousness and enormity of the lie they have made up. Allah says:</p><p>كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً تَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ</p><p>(Mighty is the word that comes out of their mouths.) meaning, it has no basis apart from what they say, and they have no evidence for it apart from their own lies and fabrications. Hence Allah says:</p><p>إِن يَقُولُونَ إِلاَّ كَذِبًا</p><p>(They utter nothing but a lie.)</p><h2>Reason why this Surah was revealed</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned the reason why this Surah was revealed. He said that an old man from among the people of Egypt who came to them some forty-odd years ago told him, from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said: ""The Quraysh sent An-Nadr bin Al-Harith and `Uqbah bin Abi Mu`it to the Jewish rabbis in Al-Madinah, and told them: `Ask them (the rabbis) about Muhammad, and describe him to them, and tell them what he is saying. They are the people of the first Book, and they have more knowledge of the Prophets than we do.' So they set out and when they reached Al-Madinah, they asked the Jewish rabbis about the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They described him to them and told them some of what he had said. They said, `You are the people of the Tawrah and we have come to you so that you can tell us about this companion of ours.' They (the rabbis) said, `Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, and if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story For theirs is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who travelled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story And ask him about the Ruh (soul or spirit) -- what is it If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.' So An-Nadr and `Uqbah left and came back to the Quraysh, and said: `O people of Quraysh, we have come to you with a decisive solution which will put an end to the problem between you and Muhammad. The Jewish rabbis told us to ask him about some matters,' and they told the Quraysh what they were. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, `O Muhammad, tell us,' and they asked him about the things they had been told to ask. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُخْبِرُكُمْ غَدًا عَمَّا سَأَلْتُمْ عَنْه»</p><p>(I will tell you tomorrow about what you have asked me.) but he did not say `If Allah wills.' So they went away, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stayed for fifteen days without any revelation from Allah concerning that, and Jibril, peace be upon him, did not come to him either. The people of Makkah started to doubt him, and said, `Muhammad promised to tell us the next day, and now fifteen days have gone by and he has not told us anything in response to the questions we asked.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ felt sad because of the delay in revelation, and was grieved by what the people of Makkah were saying about him. Then Jibril came to him from Allah with the Surah about the companions of Al-Kahf, which also contained a rebuke for feeling sad about the idolators. The Surah also told him about the things they had asked him about, the young men and the traveler. The question about the Ruh was answered in the Ayah;</p><p>وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ قُلِ الرُّوحُ</p><p>(And they ask you concerning the Ruh (the spirit); say: ""The Ruh..."") 17:85.</p>"

Qatadah said: ""killing yourself with anger and grief over them."" Mujahid said: ""with anxiety."" These are synonymous, so the meaning is: `Do not feel sorry for them, just convey the Message of Allah to them. Whoever goes the right way, then he goes the right way only for the benefit of himself. And whoever goes astray, then he strays at his own loss, so do not destroy yourself in sorrow for them.'</p><h2>This World is the Place of Trial Then Allah tells us that He has made this world a temporary abode, adorned with transient beauty, andHe made it a place of trial, not a place of settlement.

Beware of (the beguilements of) this world and beware of women, for the first affliction that Children of Israel suffered from was that of women.) Then Allah tells us that this world will pass away and come to an end, as He says:</p><p>وَإِنَّا لَجَاعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيداً جُرُزاً</p><p>(And verily, We shall make all that is on it bare, dry soil.) means, `after having adorned it, We will destroy it and make everything on it bare and dry, with no vegetation or any other benefit.' Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means everything on it would be wiped out and destroyed. Mujahid said: ""a dry and barren plain."" Qatadah said, ""A plain on which there are no trees or vegetation.""</p>"

He is not incapable of doing more amazing things than the story of the people of the Cave.

Muhammad bin Ishaq said: ""(It means) I have not shown My creatures a proof more amazing than the story of the people of the Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim."" iAl-Kahf refers to a cave in a mountain, which is where the young men sought refuge. With regard to the word Ar-Raqim, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that it is a valley near Aylah. This was also said in another narration by `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah. Ad-Dahhak said: ""As for Al-Kahf, it is a cave in the valley, and Ar-Raqim is the name of the valley."" Mujahid said, ""Ar-Raqim refers to their buildings."" Others said it refers to the valley in which their cave was. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Ar-Raqim: ""Ka`b used to say that it was the town."" Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Ar-Raqim is the mountain in which the cave was."" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, ""Ar-Raqim is a tablet of stone on which they wrote the story of the people of the Cave, then they placed it at the entrance to the Cave.""</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِذْ أَوَى الْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى الْكَهْفِ فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّىءْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا </div><p>((Remember) when the young men fled for refuge to Al-Kahf. They said: ""Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself, and facilitate for us our affair in the right way!"") Here Allah tells us about those young men who fled from their people for the sake of their religion, fearing persecution. So they fled taking refuge in the cave of a mountain, where they hid from their people. When they entered the cave, they asked Allah to show mercy and kindness towards them,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً</div><p>(Our Lord!

2251,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded a Hadith of Umm Salamah in his Sirah, and Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from Ibn Mas`ud, the story of the Hijrah (migration) to Ethiopia from Makkah. The narration mentions that Ja`far bin Abi Talib recited the first part of this Surah to An-Najashi and his companions.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Story of Zakariyya and His Supplication for a Son The discussion about the separate letters has already preceded at the beginning ofSurat Al-Baqarah.</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(A reminder of the mercy of your Lord) This means that this is a reminder of Allah's mercy upon His servant Zakariyya. Yahya bin Ya`mar recited it, (ذَكَّرَ رَحْمَةَ رَبكَ عبدَه زكريا) ""He has reminded of your Lord's mercy to His servant Zakariyya."" The word Zakariyya in the Ayah has been recited with elongation and also shortened. Both recitations are well-known. He was a great Prophet from the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded that the Prophet said about Zakariyya that He was a carpenter who used to eat from what he earned with his own hand through carpentry. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً</p><p>(When he called his Lord with a call in secret.) He only made his supplication secretly because it is more beloved to Allah. This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً</p><p>(When he called out his Lord with a call in secret. ) ""Verily, Allah knows the pious heart and he hears the hidden voice.""</p><p>قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنِّى</p><p>(He said: ""My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble..."") meaning, ""I have become weak and feeble in strength.""</p><p>وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْباً</p><p>(and gray hair has Ashta`al on my head,) means the gray hair has burned into the black hair. The intent is to inform of weakness and old age, and its external and internal traces. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً</p><p>(and I have never been unblessed in my invocation to You, O my Lord!) This means, ""I have not experienced from You except that You would respond to my supplication and that You would never refuse me in whatever I ask of You."" Concerning His statement,</p><p>وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِىَ مِن وَرَآئِى</p><p>(And verily, I fear Mawali after me,) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, ""In saying the word Mawali, he (Zakariyya) meant his succeeding relatives."" The reason for his fear was that he was afraid that the generation that would succeed him would be a wicked generation. Thus, he asked Allah for a son who would be a Prophet after him, who would guide them with his prophethood and that which was revealed to him. In response to this I would like to point out that he was not afraid of them inheriting his wealth. For a Prophet is too great in status, and too lofty in esteem to become remorseful over his wealth in this fashion. A Prophet would not disdain to leave his wealth to his successive relatives, and thus ask to have a son who would receive his inheritance instead of them. This is one angle of argument. The second argument is that Allah did not mention that he (Zakariyya) was wealthy. On the contrary, he was a carpenter who ate from the earnings of his own hand. This type of person usually does not have a mass of wealth. Amassing wealth is not something normal for Prophets, for verily, they are the most abstentious in matters of this worldly life. The third argument is that it is confirmed in the Two Sahihs, in more than one narration, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(We (the Prophets) do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity.) In a narration recorded by At-Tirmidhi with an authentic chain of narrations, he said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَث»</p><p>(We, Prophets do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth).) Therefore, the meaning in these Hadiths restricts the meaning of Zakariyya's statement,</p><p>فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاًيَرِثُنِى</p><p>(So give me from yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me,) inheritance of prophethood. For this reason Allah said,</p><p>وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ</p><p>(And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.)27:16 This means that he inherited prophethood from him. If this had meant wealth, he would not have been singled with it among his other brothers. There also would have been no important benefit in mentioning it if it was referring to wealth. It is already well-known and established in all of the previous laws and divinely revealed creeds, that the son inherits the wealth of his father. Therefore, if this was not referring to a specific type of inheritance, then Allah would not have mentioned it. All of this is supported and affirmed by what is in the authentic Hadith:</p><p>«نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(We Prophets do not leave behind any inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity.) Mujahid said concerning his statement,</p><p>يَرِثُنِى وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya'qub.) 19:6 ""His inheritance was knowledge, and Zakariyya was one of the descendants of Ya`qub."" Hushaym said, ""Isma'il bin Abi Khalid informed us that Abu Salih commented about the Ayah:</p><p>يَرِثُنِى وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) ""He would be a Prophet like his forefathers were Prophets."" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيّاً</p><p>(and make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased!) means ""Make him pleasing to You (Allah) and your creation. Love him and make him beloved to your creatures, in both his religion and his character.""</p>"

He became extremely overjoyed and asked how this child would be born to him, and in what manner he would come. This was particularly amazing because his wife was an old woman who was barren and had not given birth to any children in her entire life. Even Zakariyya himself had become old and advanced in years, his bones had become feeble and thin, and he had no potent semen or vigor for sexual intercourse. The Answer of the Angel</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَالَ</div><p>(He said:) That is, the angel, in his response to Zakariyya and his was amazement.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ</div><p>(""Thus says your Lord: `It is easy for Me...""')

Then he (the angel) mentioned to him that which is more amazing than what he was asking about. The angel said that the Lord said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئاً</div><p>(Certainly I have created you before, when you had been nothing!)

Meaning, `your tongue will be prevented from speaking for three nights while you are healthy and fit, without any sickness or illness.' Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Wahb, As-Suddi, Qatadah and others said, ""His tongue was arrested without any sickness or illness."" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, ""He used to recite and glorify Allah, but he was not able to speak to his people except by gestures. "" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثَلَـثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيّاً</div><p>(three nights, though having no bodily defect.) ""The nights were consecutive."" However, the first statement that is reported from him and the majority is more correct. This Ayah is similar to what Allah, the Exalted, said in Surah Al `Imran,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَالَ رَبِّ اجْعَل لِّى ءَايَةً قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ النَّاسَ ثَلَـثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلاَّ رَمْزًا وَاذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيرًا وَسَبِّحْ بِالْعَشِىِّ وَالإِبْكَـرِ </div><p>(He said: ""O my Lord!

Meaning, with bodily gestures, this is why Allah says in this noble Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَخَرَجَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ مِنَ الْمِحْرَابِ</div><p>(Then he came out to his people from the Mihrab) referring to the place where he was given the good news of the child.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(he indicated to them by signs) Meaning he made a gesture to them that was subtle and swift.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَن سَبِّحُواْ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً</div><p>(to glorify Allah in the morning and in the afternoon.) That they should be agreeable to what he was commanded to do during these three days, to increase in his deeds and gratitude to Allah for what He had given him.

2349,"<h2>Which was revealed at Makkah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Qur'an is a Reminder and a Revelation from Allah</h2><p>We have already discussed the separated letters at the beginning of Surah Al-Baqarah, so there is no need to repeat its discussion here. Allah says,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) Juwaybir reported that Ad-Dahhak said, ""When Allah sent the Qur'an down to His Messenger , he and his Companions adh- ered to it. Thus, the idolators of the Quraysh said, `This Qur'an was only reve- aled to Muhammad to cause him distress.' Therefore, Allah revealed,</p><p>طه - مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى - إِلاَّ تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى</p><p>(Ta Ha. We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress, but only as a Reminder to those who fear (Allah).) The matter is not like the people of falsehood claim. Rather, whomever Allah gives knowledge to, it is because Allah wants him to have an abundance of good. This like what is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ يُرِدِ اللهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّين»</p><p>(Whomever Allah wants good for, then He gives him the understanding of the religion. ) Mujahid commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) ""This is like His statement,</p><p>مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</p><p>(So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you).) 73:20 For, the people used to hang ropes at their chests (to hang on to when tired) in the prayer."" Qatadah said,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) ""No, by Allah, He did not make it a thing of distress. Rather, He made it a mercy, a light and a guide to Paradise."" Allah said,</p><p>إِلاَّ تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى</p><p>(But only as a Reminder to those who fear (Allah).) Allah revealed His Book and sent His Messenger as a mercy for His servants, so that the person who reflects may be reminded. Thus, a man will benefit from what he hears of the Book of Allah, it is a remembrance in which Allah revealed what He permits and prohibits. His saying,</p><p>تَنزِيلاً مِّمَّنْ خَلَق الاٌّرْضَ وَالسَّمَـوَتِ الْعُلَى</p><p>(A Revelation from Him (Allah) Who has created the earth and high heavens. ) means, `This Qur'an, which has come to you, O Muhammad, is a revelation from your Lord. He is the Lord of everything and its King. He is Most Able to do whatever He wills. He created the earth with its low depths and dense regions. He created the lofty heavens with their high altitudes and subtleties.' It has been reported in a Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi and others graded as authentic, that the density of each sky of the heavens is the distance of five hundred years travel and the distance between it and the next heaven is also five hundred years. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى</p><p>(The Most Gracious Istawa the Throne.) A discussion concerning this has already preceded in Surat Al-A`raf, so there is no need to repeat it here. The safest path to take in understanding this, is the way of the Salaf (predecessors). Their way was to accept that which has been reported concerning this from the Book and the Sunnah without describing it, reinterpreting it, resembling it to creation, rejecting it, or comparing it to attributes of the creatures. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِي الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil.) This means all of this is owned by Him and in His grasp. It is all under His control, will, intent and judgement. He created all of this, He owns it and He is the God of all of it. There is no true God other than He and no Lord other than He. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(and all that is under the soil.) Muhammad bin Ka`b said, ""This means that which is beneath the seventh earth."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) This means that He Who revealed this Qur'an, has also created the high heavens and the earth and He knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. As Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(Say: ""It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."") 25:6 `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) ""The secret is what the son of Adam hides within himself, and</p><p>وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(that which is yet more hidden. ) is the deeds of the son of Adam, which are hidden before he does them. Allah knows all of that. His knowledge encompasses that which has passed and that which is in the future and it is one, complete knowledge. In this regard, all of the creatures are as one soul to Him. That is the meaning of His statement,</p><p>مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</p><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.) 31:28 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Allah! There is no God but Him! To Him belongs the Best Names.) This means, `He Who revealed this Qur'an to you (O Muhammad), He is Allah, there is no God except Him. He is the Owner of the Best Names and the most lofty attributes.'</p>"

2357,"<h2>A Discussion of the Message of Musa</h2><p>From this point, Allah begins to mention the story of Musa, how revelation began to come to Him, and Allah's speaking directly to him. This occurred after Musa had completed the time agreed upon between he and his father-in-law that he would herd sheep. He was traveling with his family, and it has been said that he was headed for the land of Egypt, after having been away from it for more than ten years. He had his wife with him and he became lost on the way during a cold, wintery night. Therefore, he settled down, making a camp between some mountain passes and mountains that were covered with snow, sleet, dense clouds, darkness and fog. He began to try to make a fire with a kindling device he had with him, in order to produce some light, as was customary. However, it would not kindle anything and it even stopped giving off sparks. While he was in this condition, he saw a fire from the side of the mountain. It appeared to him to be a fire glowing from the right side of the mountain from where he was. He then announced the good news to his family saying, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنِّى ءَانَسْتُ نَاراً لَّعَلِّى آتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِقَبَسٍ</div><p>(Verily, I have seen a fire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand) This means a flame from a fire. In another Ayah he said, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ</div><p>(or a burning firebrand.) 28:29) This is a coal that has a burning flame. </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</div><p>(that you may warm yourselves. ) 28:29 This proves that it was in fact cold weather at that time. Concerning his statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بِقَبَسٍ</div><p>(some burning brand) This proves that it was dark. In reference to his statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوْ أَجِدُ عَلَى النَّارِ هُدًى</div><p>(or find some guidance at the fire.) This means someone who can guide me to the road. This proves that he lost the road. This is as Ath-Thawri reported from Abu Sa`id Al-A`war, from `Ikrimah, from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوْ أَجِدُ عَلَى النَّارِ هُدًى</div><p>(or find some guidance at the fire.) ""This means someone who will guide me to the road. They were cold and had lost their way. Then, when he (Musa) saw the fire he said, `Either I will find someone who can guide us to the road, or at least I can bring you all some fire that you can kindle with.' "" </p>"

2484,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Anbiya'</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid said that `Abdullah said, ""Banu Isra'il, Al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta Ha and Al-Anbiya' - they are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasure.""</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Hour is at hand but People are heedless</h2><p>This is a warning from Allah of the approach of the Hour, and that people are heedless of it, i.e., they are not working for it or preparing for it. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu Sa`id reported from the Prophet :</p><p>فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(while they turn away in heedlessness), he said,</p><p>«فِي الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(in this world.) Allah says:</p><p>أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</p><p>(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it)</p><p>اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ</p><p>(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away.) 54:1,2. Then Allah states that they do not listen to the revelation (Wahy) that He sends down to His Messenger , which is addressed to the Quraysh and all disbelievers like them.</p><p>مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ مُّحْدَثٍ</p><p>(Comes not unto them an admonition from their Lord as a recent revelation) meaning, newly-revealed,</p><p>إِلاَّ اسْتَمَعُوهُ وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(but they listen to it while they play. ) This is like what Ibn `Abbas said, ""Why do you ask the People of the Book about what they have, which has been altered and distorted, and they have added things and taken things away, when your Book is the most recently revealed from Allah, and you read it pure and unadulterated"" Al-Bukhari recorded something similar to this.</p><p>وَأَسَرُّواْ النَّجْوَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ</p><p>(Those who do wrong, conceal their private counsels) meaning, what they say to one another in secret.</p><p>هَلْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ</p><p>(Is this more than a human being like you) meaning, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They did not believe that he could be a Prophet because he was a human being like them, so how could he have been singled out to receive revelation, and not them They said:</p><p>أَفَتَأْتُونَ السِّحْرَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(Will you submit to magic while you see it) meaning, will you follow him and be like one who submits to magic when he knows that it is magic Allah said in response to their fabrications and lies:</p><p>قَالَ رَبِّى يَعْلَمُ الْقَوْلَ فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(He said: ""My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and on earth..."") Nothing at all is hidden from the One Who knows that, and He is the One Who reveals this Qur'an which contains news of the earliest and last generations. No one can produce the like of this except the One Who knows all the secrets of the heavens and the earth.</p><p>وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) means, He hears all that they say and He knows all their circumstances. This is a warning and a threat to them.</p><h2>The Disbelievers' Ideas about the Qur'an and the Messenger ; their demand for a Sign and the Refutation of that</h2><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ أَضْغَـثُ أَحْلاَمٍ بَلِ افْتَرَاهُ</p><p>(Nay, they say: ""These are mixed up false dreams! Nay, he has invented it!..."") Here Allah tells us of the stubbornness and heresy of the disblievers, and the various things they said about the Qur'an, and how they were confused and misguided about it. Sometimes they described it as magic, and sometimes they described it as poetry, or mixed up false dreams, or a fabrication. As Allah says:</p><p>انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way) 17:48</p><p>فَلْيَأْتِنَا بِـَايَةٍ كَمَآ أُرْسِلَ الاٌّوَّلُونَ</p><p>(Let him then bring us an Ayah like the ones that were sent before!) They were referring to the she-camel of Salih, and the signs of Musa and `Isa. And Allah says,</p><p>وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالاٌّيَـتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ</p><p>(And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them.) 17:59. So Allah said here:</p><p>مَآ ءَامَنَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَآ أَفَهُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(Not one of the towns of those which We destroyed, believed before them; will they then believe) None of the peoples to whom Messengers were sent were given a sign at the hands of their Prophet and believed. On the contrary, they disbelieved and We destroyed them as a result. Would these people believe in a sign if they saw it Not at all! In fact,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:96-97. Indeed, they witnes- sed clear signs and definitive proof at the hands of the Messen- ger of Allah , signs which were far clearer and more overwhel- ming than any that had been witnessed in the case of any other Prophet, may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all.</p>"

Then he said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a quarter of the people of Paradise.) They said, ""Allahu Akbar!""

Among mankind you are like a black hair on the side of a white bull, or a white hair on the side of a black bull. I hope that you will be one quarter of the people of Paradise.) We said ""Allahu Akbar!"" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, ""Allahu Akbar!"" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!"" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. The Hadiths and reports about the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are very many, and this is not the place to quote them all.</p><p>إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.) means, a serious matter, a terrifying crisis, a horrendous event. This earthquake is what will happen to people when they are filled with terror, as Allah says:</p><p>هُنَالِكَ ابْتُلِىَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُواْ زِلْزَالاً شَدِيداً</p><p>(There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking.) 33:11. Then Allah says:</p><p>يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ</p><p>(The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling,) means, she will be distracted by the horror of what she is seeing, which will make her forget the one who is the dearest of all to her and to whom she shows the most compassion. Her shock will make her neglect her infant at the very moment of breastfeeding, Allah says,</p><p>كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ</p><p>(every nursing mother), and He did not say a mother who has an infant of breastfeeding age.</p><p>عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ</p><p>(her nursling) means, her nursing infant that has not yet been weaned.</p><p>وَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا</p><p>(and every pregnant one will drop her load,) means, before the pre- gnancy has reached full term, because of the intensity of the horror.</p><p>وَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى</p><p>(and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state,) means, because of the severity of their situa- tion, when they will lose their minds, so that whoever sees them, will think, that they are drunk,</p><p>وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)</p>"

2598,"<h2>Condemnation of the Followers of the Shaytan</h2>				Allah condemns those who deny the Resurrection and who deny that Allah is able to restore life to the dead, those who turn away from that which Allah has revealed to His Prophets and, in their views -- denial and disbelief -- follow every rebellious Shaytan among men and Jinn. This is the state of the followers of innovation and misguidance, who turn away from the truth and follow falsehood, following the words of the leaders of misguidance who call people to follow innovation and their own desires and opinions. Allah says concerning them and their like,<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge,) meaning, without sound knowledge.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍكُتِبَ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(and follows every rebellious Shaytan. For him it is decreed.) Mujahid said, ""This refers to that Shaytan."" meaning that is a matter written in the decree.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَنَّهُ مَن تَوَلاَّهُ</div><p>(that whosoever follows him,) and imitates him,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَأَنَّهُ يُضِلُّهُ وَيَهْدِيهِ إِلَى عَذَابِ السَّعِيرِ</div><p>(he will mislead him, and will drive him to the torment of the Fire.) means, he will mislead him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will drive him to the torment of the Fire, which is unbearably hot, painful and agonizing. As-Suddi reported that Abu Malik said, ""This Ayah was revealed about An-Nadr bin Al-Harith. This was also the view of Ibn Jurayj.</p>"

2600,"<h2>Evidence of the Resurrection in the creation of Man and of Plants</h2><p>When Allah speaks of disbelief in the Resurrection, He also mentions the evidence of His power and ability to resurrect that is evident from the way He initiates creation. Allah says:</p><p>يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ</p><p>(O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection,) which means the time when souls and bodies will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ</p><p>(then verily, We have created you from dust,) meaning, `you were originally created from dust', which is what Adam, peace be upon him, was created from.</p><p>ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ</p><p>(then from a Nutfah,) 32:8 meaning, then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.</p><h2>The Development of the Nutfah and Embryo in the Womb</h2><p>ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ</p><p>(then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh) if the Nutfah establishes itself in the woman's womb, it stays like that for forty days, then more material is added to it and it changes into a red clot, by the leave of Allah, and it remains like that for forty days. Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed. As Allah says:</p><p>ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ</p><p>(then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed) meaning, as you see.</p><p>لِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى</p><p>(that We may make (it) clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term,) meaning that sometimes the fetus remains in the womb and is not miscarried.</p><p>مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ</p><p>(some formed and some unformed, ) Mujahid said, ""This means the miscarried fetus, formed or unformed. When forty days have passed of it being a lump of flesh, then Allah sends an angel to it who breathes the soul into it and forms it as Allah wills, handsome or ugly, male or female. He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched."" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who is the true and truly inspired one, told us:</p><p>«إِنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ اللهُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكَ فَيُؤْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ: بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ، وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح»</p><p>(Every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a lump of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his provision, his deeds, his life span, and whether he will be blessed or wretched. Then he blows the soul into him.)""</p><h2>Man's Development from Infancy to Old Age His saying;</h2><p>ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً</p><p>(then We bring you out as infants,) means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. Allah says:</p><p>ثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُواْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ</p><p>(then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength.) meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth.</p><p>وَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّى</p><p>(And among you there is he who dies,) means, when he is young and strong.</p><p>وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ</p><p>(and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age,) meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. As Allah says:</p><p>لِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً</p><p>(so that he knows nothing after having known.)</p><p>اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ</p><p>(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.) 30:54</p><h2>Another Parable of the Resurrection from Plants</h2><p>وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ هَامِدَةً</p><p>(And you see the earth Hamidatan,) This is another sign of the power of Allah to bring the dead back to life, just as He brings the dead, barren earth back to life, the lifeless earth in which nothing grows. Qatadah said, ""(This means) the eroded, dusty earth."" As-Suddi said, ""Dead.""</p><p>فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ</p><p>(but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) When Allah sends the rain upon it, it is stirred to life, that is, vegetation begins to grow and it comes alive after it was dead. Then it rises after the soil had settled, then it puts forth its different kinds of fruit and crops with all their varied colours, tastes, fragrances, shapes and benefits. Allah says:</p><p>وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ</p><p>(and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances.</p><p>ذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ</p><p>(That is because Allah: He is the Truth,) means, the Creator, the Controller, the One Who does as He wills.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(and it is He Who gives life to the dead,) means, just as He gives life to the dead earth and brings forth from it all these kinds of vegetation.</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is able to do all things.) 41:39</p><p>إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, ""Be!"" -- and it is!) 36:82.</p><p>وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا</p><p>(And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it;) meaning, it will inevitably come to pass.</p><p>وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى الْقُبُورِ</p><p>(and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) means, He will bring them back to life after they have become dust; He will create them anew after they have become nothing.</p><p>وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ</p><p>قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الاٌّخْضَرِ نَاراً فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْه تُوقِدُونَ</p><p>(And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: ""Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust"" Say: ""He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!"" He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle there- with.) 36:78-80. And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>ومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ</p>"

2603,"<h2>Clarifying the State of the Leaders of the Innovators and Those Who lead People astray</h2><p>Allah has already told us about the ignorant imitators who are led astray:</p><p>وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍ</p><p>(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge, and follows every rebellious Shaytan.) And here He tells us about those who call others to misguidance, the leaders of disbelief and innovation:</p><p>ومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ</p><p>(And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah).) meaning, with no correct rational thought, and no clear transmitted text; what they say is based only on their opinions and whims. Allah's saying,</p><p>ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ</p><p>(Bending his neck in pride,) Ibn `Abbas and others said, ""Too proud to follow the truth when he is called to it."" Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam:</p><p>ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ</p><p>(Bending his neck in pride,) means, twisting his neck, i.e., turning away from the truth to which he is called, bending his neck out of pride and arrogance. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَفِى مُوسَى إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ</p><p>(And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority. But (Fir`awn) turned away along with his hosts) 51:38-39,</p><p>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَى مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ وَإِلَى الرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً</p><p>(And when it is said to them: ""Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,"" you see the hypocrites turn away from you with aversion.) 4:61,</p><p>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ يَسْتَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ لَوَّوْاْ رُءُوسَهُمْ وَرَأَيْتَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ وَهُم مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ</p><p>(And when it is said to them: ""Come, so that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ may ask forgiveness from Allah for you,"" they twist their heads, and you would see them turning away their faces in pride.) 63:5, And Luqman said to his son:</p><p>وَلاَ تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ</p><p>(And turn not your face away from men with pride) 31:18 meaning, do not turn away from them in an arrogant manner. And Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا وَلَّى مُسْتَكْبِراً</p><p>(And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns away in pride) 31:7.</p><p>لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(and leading (others) too (far) astray from the path of Allah.) This either refers to those who are stubborn, or it means that the person who does this has been created like this so that he will be one of those who lead others astray from the path of Allah. Then Allah says:</p><p>لَهُ فِى الدُّنْيَا خِزْىٌ</p><p>(For him there is disgrace in this worldly life,) meaning, humiliation and shame, such as when he is too arrogant to heed the signs of Allah, so Allah will send humiliation upon him in this world and will punish him in this world, before he reaches the Hereafter, because this world is all he cares about and all he knows.</p><p>وَنُذِيقُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِذلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاكَ</p><p>(and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the torment of burning. That is because of what your hands have sent forth,) means, this will be said to him by way of rebuke.</p><p>وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ</p><p>(and verily, Allah is not unjust to the servants.) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ</p><p>((It will be said: ) ""Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!"") 44:47-50</p>"

2674,"<h2>Which was Revealed in Makkah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Success is for the believers whose qualities are described here</h2><p>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(Successful indeed are the believers) means, they have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded. These are the believers who have the following characteristics:</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلاَتِهِمْ خَـشِعُونَ</p><p>(Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:</p><p>خَـشِعُونَ</p><p>""(Khashi`un) means those with fear and with tranquillity."" This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri. It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the Khushu` of the heart. This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, ""Their Khushu` was in their hearts."" So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others. Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ الطِّيبُ وَالنِّسَاءُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاة»</p><p>(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُّعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.) refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit. As Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا مَرُّواْ بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّواْ كِراماً</p><p>(And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity)25:72. Qatadah said: ""By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).""</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَـوةِ فَـعِلُونَ</p><p>(And those who pay the Zakah.) Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah:</p><p>وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</p><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) 6:141 It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:</p><p>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا</p><p>(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) 91:9-10 It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one's wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَـفِظُونَ - إِلاَّ عَلَى أَزْوَجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ - فَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَآءَ ذلِكَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ</p><p>(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.) means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives. One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him. Allah says:</p><p>فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَفَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَآءَ ذلِكَ</p><p>(they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that) meaning, other than a wife or slave girl,</p><p>فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ</p><p>(then those are the transgressors.) meaning , aggressors.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لاًّمَـنَـتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَعُونَ</p><p>(Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants) When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word. This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا اؤْتُمِنَ خَان»</p><p>(The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَى صَلَوَتِهِمْ يُحَـفِظُونَ</p><p>(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.) means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: ""I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah' He said,</p><p>«الصَّلَاةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا»</p><p>(Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what' He said,</p><p>«بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن»</p><p>(Kindness to one's parents. ) I said, `Then what' He said,</p><p>«الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</p><p>(Jihad in the way of Allah.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: ""At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration."" Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said:</p><p>«اسْتَقِيمُوا وَلَنْ تُحْصُوا، وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ خَيْرَ أَعْمَالِكُمُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَلَا يُحَافِظُ عَلَى الْوُضُوءِ إِلَّا مُؤْمِن»</p><p>(Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu' except the believer.) Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ - الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ الْجَنَّةَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ، فَإِنَّهُ أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَأَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمن»</p><p>(If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَلَهُ مَنْزِلَانِ: مَنْزِلٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَمَنْزِلٌ فِي النَّارِ، فَإِنْ مَاتَ فَدَخَلَ النَّارَ وَرِثَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ مَنْزِلَهُ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ</p><p>»</p><p>(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.) Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ</p><p>(These are indeed the heirs.) ""The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well."" This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said:</p><p>«يَجِيءُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَاسٌ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِذُنُوبٍ أَمْثَالِ الْجِبَالِ،فَيَغْفِرُهَا اللهُ لَهُمْ وَيَضَعُهَا عَلَى الْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَى»</p><p>(Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.) According to another version: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ دَفَعَ اللهُ لِكُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ يَهُودِيًّا أَوْ نَصْرَانِيًّا، فَيُقَالُ: هَذَا فِكَاكُكَ مِنَ النَّار»</p><p>(When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, ""This is your ransom from the Fire."") `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah's saying:</p><p>تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّاً</p><p>(Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) 19:63</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) 43:72</p>"

2792,"<h2>Which was Revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Importance of Surat An-Nur</h2><p>سُورَةٌ أَنزَلْنَـهَا</p><p>(A Surah which We have sent down) Here Allah is pointing out the high esteem in which He holds this Surah, which is not to say that other Surahs are not important.</p><p>وَفَرَضْنَـهَا</p><p>(and which We have enjoined,) Mujahid and Qatadah said, ""This means: We have explained what is lawful and unlawful, commands and prohibitions, and the prescribed punishments."" Al-Bukhari said, ""Those who read it: Faradnaha, say that it means: ""We have enjoined them upon you and those who come after you.""</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا فِيهَآ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</p><p>(and in it We have revealed manifest Ayat,) means, clearly explained,</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(that you may remember.)</p><h2>The Explanation of the Prescribed Punishment for Zina (Illicit Sex)</h2><p>Then Allah says:</p><p>الزَّانِيَةُ وَالزَّانِى فَاجْلِدُواْ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا مِاْئَةَ جَلْدَةٍ</p><p>(The Zaniyah and the Zani, flog each of them with a hundred stripes.) This honorable Ayah contains the ruling on the law of retaliation for the person who commits illegal sex, and details of the punishment. Such a person will either be unmarried, meaning that he has never been married, or he will be married, meaning that he has had intercourse within the bounds of a lawful marriage, and he is free, adult and of sound mind. As for the virgin who is unwedded, the prescribed punishment is one hundred stripes, as stated in this Ayah. In addition to this he is to be banished from his homeland for one year, as was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah and Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani in the Hadith about the two bedouins who came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. One of them said, ""O Messenger of Allah, this son of mine was employed by this man, and committed Zina with his wife. I paid a ransom with him on behalf of my son one hundred sheep and a slave-girl, but when I asked the people of knowledge, they said that my son should be given one hundred stripes and banished for a year, and that this man's wife should be stoned to death."" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَأَقْضِيَنَّ بَيْنَكُمَا بِكِتَابِ اللهِ تَعَالى، الْوَلِيدَةُ وَالْغَنَمُ رَدٌّ عَلَيْكَ، وَعَلى ابْنِكَ جَلْدُ مِائَةٍ وَتَغْرِيبُ عَامٍ، وَاغْدُ يَا أُنَيْسُ لِرَجُلٍ مِنْ أَسْلَمَ إِلَى امْرَأَةِ هذَا،فَإِنِ اعْتَرَفَتْ فَارْجُمْهَا»</p><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will judge between you both according to the Book of Allah. Take back the slave-girl and sheep, and your son is to be given one hundred stripes and banished for one year. O Unays -- he said to a man from the tribe of Aslam -- go to this man's wife, and if she confesses, then stone her to death.) Unays went to her and she confessed, so he stoned her to death. This indicates that if the person who is guilty of illegal sex is a virgin and unmarried, he should be banished in addition to being given one hundred stripes. But if married, meaning he has had intercourse within the bounds of lawful marriage, and he is free, adult and of sound mind, then he should be stoned to death. Imam Malik recorded that `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and praised and glorified Allah, then he said; ""O people! Allah sent Muhammad with the truth, and revealed to him the Book. One of the things that was revealed to him was the Ayah of stoning to death, which we have recited and understood. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ carried out the punishment of stoning and after him we did so, but I am afraid that as time goes by, some will say that they did not find the Ayah of stoning in the Book of Allah, and they will go astray because they abandoned one of the obligations revealed by Allah. Stoning is something that is prescribed in the Book of Allah for the person -- man or woman -- who commits illegal sex, if he or she is married, if decisive evidence is produced, or if pregnancy results from that, or if they confess to it."" It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs in the lengthy Hadith of Malik, from which we have quoted briefly only the portion that is relevant to the current discussion.</p><h2>Do not feel pity for Them when carrying out the Prescribed Punishment</h2><p>وَلاَ تَأْخُذْكُمْ بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِى دِينِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah,) Meaning, with a ruling prescribed by Allah. So the meaning of the Ayah is: ""Do not feel too sorry for them where the laws of Allah are established."" This does not mean that we should not naturally feel pity when carrying out the punishment. What is prohibited here is the kind of pity that may make the judge ignore the punishment altogether. This is what is not permitted for the judge. Mujahid said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْخُذْكُمْ بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِى دِينِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah,) ""If the matter is taken to the ruling authority, the punishment has to be carried out and cannot be stopped."" This was also narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr and `Ata' bin Abi Rabah. It was recorded in a Hadith:</p><p>«تَعَافَوُا الْحُدُودَ فِيمَا بَيْنَكُمْ، فَمَا بَلَغَنِي مِنْ حَدَ فَقَدْ وَجَبَ»</p><p>(Compromise with the matter of prescribed punishment mutually sorting it out among yourselves, for once a matter where the prescribed punishment is required reaches me, I am obliged to carry it out.) Allah's saying:</p><p>إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</p><p>(if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. ) means, then do that, carry out the punishments on those who commit illegal sex, and strike them hard without causing any wound, so that he and others like him will be deterred by the terror of that. In Al-Musnad, it was recorded that one of the Companions said, ""O Messenger of Allah, when I slaughter a sheep I feel pity for it."" He said,</p><p>«وَلَكَ فِي ذلِكَ أَجْرٌ»</p><p>(You be rewarded for that.)</p><h2>Carry out the Prescribed Punishment in Public</h2><p>وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.) This is more humiliating for the people who are guilty of illegal sex, if they are flogged in front of the people. This is because it is more effective as a deterrent and it conveys the sense of scandal and rebuke. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said,</p><p>وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.) ""Publicly.""</p>"
2793,
2794,"<p>وَالزَّانِيَةُ لاَ يَنكِحُهَآ إِلاَّ زَانٍ</p><p>(and the Zaniyah, none marries her except a Zani) a sinful man who is guilty of fornication,</p><p>أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً</p><p>(or a Mushrik) (a man) who does not think it is unlawful.</p><p>وَحُرِّمَ ذلِكَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(Such a thing is forbidden to the believers.) meaning, indulging in this, or marrying prostitutes, or marrying chaste women to immoral men. Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said: ""Allah forbade the believers from marrying prostitutes."" This Ayah is like the Ayah (about marrying slave-girls):</p><p>مُحْصَنَـت غَيْرَ مُسَـفِحَـتٍ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذَاتِ أَخْدَانٍ</p><p>(they should be chaste, not committing illegal sex, nor taking boyfriends.) 4:25 And His saying:</p><p>مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذِى أَخْدَانٍ</p><p>(desiring chastity not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends) 5:5. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said that a man among the believers asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for permission (to marry) a woman known as Umm Mahzul, who used to commit adultery, and who had stated the condition that she should spend on him. So he asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for permission, or he mentioned the matter to him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited to him:</p><p>الزَّانِى لاَ يَنكِحُ إِلاَّ زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَالزَّانِيَةُ لاَ يَنكِحُهَآ إِلاَّ زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ وَحُرِّمَ ذلِكَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(The Zani marries not but a Zaniyah or a Mushrikah; and the Zaniyah, none marries her except Zani or a Mushrik. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers.) 24:3 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p><p>«لَا يَنْكِحُ الزَّانِي الْمَجْلُودُ إِلَّا مِثْلَهُ»</p><p>(A Zani who has been flogged should not marry anyone except someone who is like him.) A similar report was recorded by Abu Dawud in his Sunan.</p>"
2795,"<h2>The Prescribed Punishment for slandering Chaste Women</h2><p>This Ayah states the prescribed punishment for making false accusations against chaste women, i.e., those who are free, adult and chaste. If the person who is falsely accused is a man, the same punishment of flogging also applies. If the accuser produces evidence that what he is saying is true, then the punishment does not apply. Allah said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَاجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ</div><p>(and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the rebellious.) If the accuser cannot prove that what he is saying is true, then three rulings apply to him: (firstly) that he should be flogged with eighty stripes, (secondly) that his testimony should be rejected forever, and (thirdly) that he should be labelled as a rebellious who is not of good character, whether in the sight of Allah or of mankind.</p><h2>Explaining the Repentance of the One Who makes a False Accusation</h2><p>Then Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous deeds; (for such) verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This exception refers to the second and third rulings mentioned above. The flogging has been carried out regardless of whether he repents or persists, and after that there is no further punishment, as is agreed among the scholars. If he repents, then his testimony may be accepted, and he is no longer to be regarded as a rebellious. This was the view of Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib -- the leader of the Tabi`in -- and also a group among the Salaf. Ash-Sha`bi and Ad-Dahhak said, ""His testimony cannot be accepted even if he does repent, unless he himself admits that he said something false, in which case his testimony may be accepted."" And Allah knows best.</p>"
2796,
2797,"<h2>Details of Al-Li`an</h2>
<p>This Ayah offers a way out for husbands. If a husband has accused his wife but cannot come up with proof, he can swear the Li`an (the oath of condemnation) as Allah commanded. This means that he brings her before the Imam and states what he is accusing her of. The ruler then asks him to swear four times by Allah in front of four witnesses</p>
<p>إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</p>
<p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) in his accusation of her adultery.</p>
<p>وَالْخَامِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ</p>
<p>(And the fifth; the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie.) If he says that, then she is divorced from him by the very act of this Li`an; she is forever forbidden for him and he must give her Mahr to her. The punishment for Zina should be carried out on her, and nothing can prevent the punishment except if she also swears the oath of condemnation (Li`an) and swears by Allah four times that he is one of those who lied, i.e., in what he is accusing her of;</p>
<p>وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</p>
<p>(And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) Allah says:</p>
<p>وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا الْعَذَابَ</p>
<p>(But she shall avert the punishment) meaning, the prescribed punishment.</p>
<p>وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا الْعَذَابَ أَن تَشْهَدَ أَرْبَعَ شَهَادَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ - وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</p>
<p>(if she bears witness four times by Allah, that he is telling a lie. And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) The wrath of Allah is mentioned specially in the case of the woman, because usually a man would not go to the extent of exposing his wife and accusing her of Zina unless he is telling the truth and has good reason to do this, and she knows that what he is accusing her of is true. So in her case the fifth testimony calls for the wrath of Allah to be upon her, for the one upon whom is the wrath of Allah, is the one who knows the truth yet deviates from it. Then Allah mentions His grace and kindness to His creation in that He has prescribed for them a way out of their difficulties. Allah says:</p>
<p>وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ</p>
<p>(And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you!) meaning, many of your affairs would have been too difficult for you,</p>
<p>وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ</p>
<p>(And that Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance,) means, from His servants, even if that comes after they have sworn a confirmed oath.</p>
<p>حَكِيمٌ</p>
<p>(the All-Wise. ) in what He prescribes and commands and forbids. There are Hadiths which explain how we are to put this Ayah into effect, why it was revealed and concerning whom among the Companions it was revealed.</p>
<h2>The Reason why the Ayah of Li`an was revealed</h2>
<p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: ""When the Ayah</p>
<p>وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ الْمُحْصَنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَاجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً</p>
<p>(And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever) 24:4 was revealed, Sa`d bin `Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him, -- the leader of the Ansar -- said, `Is this how it was revealed, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<p>«يَا مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْصَارِ أَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ مَا يَقُولُ سَيِّدُكُمْ؟»</p>
<p>(O Ansar, did you hear what your leader said) They said, `O Messenger of Allah, do not blame him, for he is a jealous man. By Allah, he never married a woman who was not a virgin, and he never divorced a woman but none of us would dare to marry her because he is so jealous.' Sa`d said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I know that it (the Ayah) is true and is from Allah, but I am surprised. If I found some wicked man lying down with my wife, should I not disturb him until I have brought four witnesses By Allah, he would have finished what he was doing before I could bring them!' A little while later, Hilal bin Umayyah -- one of the three whose repentance had been accepted -- came back from his lands at night and found a man with his wife. He saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears, but he did not disturb him until the morning. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I came to my wife at night and found a man with her, and I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not like what he had said and got very upset. The Ansar gathered around him and said, `We were being tested by what Sa`d bin Ubadah said, and now the Messenger of Allah ﷺ will punish Hilal bin Umayyah and declare his testimony before people to be unacceptable.' Hilal said: `By Allah, I hope that Allah will make for me a way out from this problem.' Hilal said, `O Messenger of Allah, I see how upset you are by what I have said, but Allah knows that I am telling the truth.' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wanted to have him flogged, but then Allah sent revelation to His Messenger . When the revelation came upon him, they knew about it from the change in his face, so they would leave him alone until the revelation was finished. Allah revealed the Ayah:</p>
<p>وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَـدَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَـدَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ</p>
<p>(And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah...,) Then the revelation was finished and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«أَبْشِرْ يَا هِلَالُ فَقَدْ جَعَلَ اللهُ لَكَ فَرَجًا وَمَخْرَجًا»</p>
<p>(Rejoice, O Hilal, for Allah has made a way out for you.) Hilal said, `I had been hoping for this from my Lord, may He be glorified.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<p>«أَرْسِلُوا إِلَيْهَا»</p>
<p>(Send for her.) So they sent for her and she came. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah to them both, and reminded them that the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe than the punishment in this world. Hilal said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I have spoken the truth about her.' She said, `He is lying.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«لَاعِنُوا بَيْنَهُمَا»</p>
<p>(Make them both swear the Li`an.) So Hilal was told, `Testify.' So he testified four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth. When he came to the fifth testimony, he was told, `O Hilal, have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' He said, `By Allah, Allah will not punish me for it, just as He has not caused me to be flogged for it.' So he testified for the fifth time that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he was telling a lie. Then it was said to his wife, `Testify four times by Allah that he is telling a lie.' And when his wife reached the fifth testimony, she was told, `Have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' She hesitated for a while, and was about to admit her guilt, then she said: `By Allah, I will not expose my people to shame, and she swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth.' Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ separated them, and decreed that her child should not be attributed to any father, nor should the child be accused, and whoever accused her or her child, they would be subject to punishment. He also decreed that Hilal was not obliged to house her or feed her, because they had not been separated by divorce, nor had he died and left her a widow. He said,</p>
<p>«إِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أُصَيْهِبَ (أُرَيْسِحَ) حَمْشَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِهِلَالٍ، وَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَوْرَقَ جَعَدًا جُمَالِيًّا خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِلَّذِي رُمِيَتْتِبهِ»</p>
<p>(If she gives birth to a red-haired child (with skinny thighs) and thin legs, then he is Hilal's child, but if she gives birth to a curly-haired child with thick legs and plump buttocks, then this is what she is accused of.) She subsequently gave birth to a child who was curly-haired with thick legs and plump buttocks, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«لَوْلَا الْأَيْمَانُ لَكَانَ لِي وَلَهَا شَأْنٌ»</p>
<p>(Were it not for the oath that she swore, I would deal with her.)"" `Ikrimah said, ""The child grew up to become the governor of Egypt, and he was given his mother's name and was not attributed to any father."" Abu Dawud recorded a similar but briefer report. This Hadith has corroborating reports in the books of Sahih and elsewhere, with many chains of narration, including the report narrated by Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Abbas, that Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife before the Prophet with Sharik bin Sahma'. The Prophet said,</p>
<p>«الْبَيِّنَةَ أَوْحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</p>
<p>(Evidence or the punishment on your back.) He said, ""O Messenger of Allah, if any one of us saw a man with his wife, how could he go and get evidence"" The Prophet again said,</p>
<p>«الْبَيِّنَةَ وَإِلَّاحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</p>
<p>(Evidence otherwise the punishment on your back.) Hilal said, ""By the One Who sent you with the truth! I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal something that will protect my back from the punishment. "" Then Jibril came down and brought the revelation,</p>
<p>وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</p>
<p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) Then he recited until he reached:</p>
<p>إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</p>
<p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) 24:6. When the revelation had finished, the Prophet sent for them both. Hilal came and gave his testimony, and the Prophet said,</p>
<p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمَا كَاذِبٌ، فَهَلْ مِنْكُمَا تَائِبٌ؟»</p>
<p>(Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent) Then she stood up and gave her testimony, and when she reached the fifth oath, they stopped her and said, ""If you swear the fifth oath and you are lying, the curse of Allah will be inevitable."" Ibn `Abbas said, ""She hesitated and kept quiet until we thought that she had changed her mind, then she said, `I will not dishonor my people today', and she went ahead. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p>«أَبْصِرُوهَا، فَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَكْحَلَ الْعَيْنَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِشَرِيكِ ابْنِ سَحْمَاءَ»</p>
<p>(Wait until she gives birth, and if she gives birth to a child whose eyes look as if they are ringed with kohl and who has plump buttocks and thick legs, then he is the child of Sharik bin Sahma'.) She gave birth to a child who matched this description, and the Prophet said,</p>
<p>«لَوْلَا مَا مَضَى مِنْ كِتَابِ اللهِ لَكَانَ لِي وَ لَهَا شَأْنٌ»</p>
<p>(Were it not for the Book of Allah, I would deal with her.) This version was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, but the event has been narrated with additional chains of narration from Ibn `Abbas and others. Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: During the governorship of Ibn Az-Zubayr I was asked about the couple who engage in Li`an, and whether they should be separated, and I did not know the answer. I got up and went to the house of Ibn `Umar, and said, ""O Abu `Abdur-Rahman, should the couple who engage in Li`an be separated"" He said, ""Subhan Allah, the first one to ask about this was so-and-so the son of so-and-so. He said, `O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of a man who sees his wife committing an immoral sin If he speaks he will be speaking about something very serious, and if he keeps quiet he will be keeping quiet about something very serious.' The Prophet kept quiet and did not answer him. Later on, he came to him and said, `What I asked you about is something with which I myself being tested with.' Then Allah revealed the Ayat,</p>
<p>وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</p>
<p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) until he reached:</p>
<p>أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</p>
<p>(That the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) He started to advise the man and remind him about Allah, and told him that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The man said: `By the One Who sent you with the truth, I was not telling you a lie.' Then the Prophet turned to the woman and advised the woman and reminded her about Allah, and told her that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The woman said, `By the One Who sent you with the truth, he is lying.' So the Prophet started with the man, who swore four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth, and swore the fifth oath that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he were lying. Then he turned to the woman, who swore four times by Allah that he was lying, and swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth. Then he separated them."" It was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Two Sahihs.</p>"

This is like the Ayat:</p><p>الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَـبَ وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُ عِوَجَا قَيِّماً لِّيُنْذِرَ بَأْسًا شَدِيدًا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ الصَّـلِحَاتِ</p><p>(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant the Book, and has not placed therein any crookedness. (He has made it) straight to give warning of a severe punishment from Him, and to give glad tidings to the believers, who do righteous deeds...) 18:1-2 Here Allah says:</p><p>تَبَارَكَ</p><p>(Blessed be He.) The verbal form used here implies an ongoing, permanent, eternal blessing.</p><p>الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ</p><p>(Who sent down the criterion) The verb Nazzala is a form which implies something done a great deal and often. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَالْكِتَـبِ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَـبِ الَّذِى أَنَزلَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(And the Book which He (Nazzala) sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He (Anzala) sent down to those before (him)) (4:136). Each of the previous Books was sent down at one time, but the Qur'an was revealed gradually, in stages, Ayat after Ayat, rulings after rulings, Surahs after Surahs. This is more eloquent and indicative of greater care for the one to whom it is revealed, as Allah says later in this Surah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الْقُرْءَانُ جُمْلَةً وَحِدَةً كَذَلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ تَرْتِيلاً - وَلاَ يَأْتُونَكَ بِمَثَلٍ إِلاَّ جِئْنَـكَ بِالْحَقِّ وَأَحْسَنَ تَفْسِيراً</p><p>(And those who disbelieve say: ""Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all at once"" Thus, that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages. And no example or similitude do they bring, but We reveal to you the truth, and the better explanation thereof.) (25:32-33) This Surah was named Al-Furqan, because it is the criterion that decides between truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, right and wrong, lawful and unlawful.</p><p>عَلَى عَبْدِهِ</p><p>(to His servant) This description is one of praise and commendation, because here Allah is connecting him to Himself, describing him as His servant. Allah also described him in this manner when referring to the noblest of events, the Night of the Isra', as He said:</p><p>سُبْحَانَ الَّذِى أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً</p><p>(Glorified be He Who took His servant for a journey by night) (17:1). Allah also described him in this way when He described how he stood and called to Him:</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ لَّمَا قَامَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً</p><p>(And when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they (the Jinn) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet's recitation).) (72:19) This description is also used here when Allah describes how the Book is revealed to him and how the angel comes down to him:</p><p>تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً</p><p>(Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to all nations.)</p><p>لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً</p><p>(that he may be a warner to all nations.) means, he alone has been blessed with this great, detailed, clear Book which,</p><p>لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ</p><p>(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah).) (41:42) The One Who made it the mighty criterion, singled him out to convey it to those who seek the shade of trees and to those who live on the land (i.e., to all of mankind, nomad and settled alike), as the Prophet said:</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الْأَحْمَرِ وَالْأَسْوَد»</p><p>(I have been sent to the red and the black.) And he said:</p><p>«إِنِّي أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي»</p><p>(I have been given five things which no Prophet before me was given. ) Among them he mentioned:</p><p>«كَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»</p><p>(Before me a Prophet was sent only to his own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind.) And Allah says:</p><p>قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</p><p>(Say: ""O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah..."") (7:158), meaning, the One Who has sent me is the Sovereign of the heaven and the earth, who merely says to a thing ""Be!"" and it is. He is the one who gives life and causes death. Allah says here:</p><p>الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَداً وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِى المُلْكِ</p><p>(He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who has begotten no son and for Whom there is no partner in the dominion.) Allah states that He is above having any offspring or partner. Then He tells us:</p><p>خَـلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍفَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.) meaning, everything apart from Him is created and subject to Him. He is the Creator, Lord, Master and God of all things, and everything is subject to His dominion, control and power.</p>"
2857,
2858,"<h2>The Foolishness of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah tells us of the ignorance of the idolators in taking other gods instead of Allah, the Creator of all things, the One Who controls the affairs of all things; whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. In spite of that, they still worshipped others besides Him, idols who could not even create the wing of a gnat, but were themselves created. They could neither do harm nor bring benefit to themselves, so how could they do anything for their worshippers</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُونَ مَوْتاً وَلاَ حَيَـوةً وَلاَ نُشُوراً</div><p>(and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead.) means, they could not do any of that at all; that power belongs only to Allah, Who is the One Who gives life and death, and is the One Who will bring all people, the first and the last, back to life on the Day of Resurrection.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</div><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person) (31:28). This is like the Ayat;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ </div><p>(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ </div><p>(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they find themselves on the surface of the earth alive after their death.) (79:13-14)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ فَإِذَا هُمْ يَنظُرُونَ </div><p>(It will be a single Zajrah, and behold, they will be staring!) (37:19)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِن كَانَتْ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ </div><p>(It will be but a single Sayhah, so behold they will all be brought up before Us!) (36:53). He is Allah besides Whom there is no other God and besides Whom there is no other Lord. No one should be worshipped except Him because whatever He wills happens and whatever he does not will does not happen. He has no offspring nor progenitor, nor equal nor likeness nor rival nor peer. He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He begets not, nor was He begotten, and there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.</p>"
2859,"<h2>What the Disbelievers said about the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah tells us about the foolishness of the disbelievers' ignorant minds, when they said about the Qur'an:</p><p>إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ</p><p>(This is nothing but a lie), meaning an untruth.</p><p>افْتَرَاهُ</p><p>(that he has invented,) meaning the Prophet .</p><p>وَأَعَانَهُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْمٌ ءَاخَرُونَ</p><p>(and others have helped him in it.) means, he asked other people to help him compile it. So Allah said:</p><p>فَقَدْ جَآءُوا ظُلْماً وَزُوراً</p><p>(In fact, they have produced an unjust wrong and a lie.) meaning, they are the ones who are telling a lie, and they know that it is false, for their own souls know that what they are claiming is not true.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا</p><p>(And they say: ""Tales of the ancients which he has written down..."") meaning, the ancients wrote them down, and he has copied it.</p><p>فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(and they are dictated to him) means, they are read or recited to him.</p><p>بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً</p><p>(morning and afternoon. ) at the beginning and end of the day. Because this idea is so foolish and is so patently false, everyone knows that it is not true. It is known through Mutawatir reports and is a common fact that Muhammad ﷺ the Messenger of Allah never learned to read or write, either at the beginning or the end of his life. He grew up among them for approximately forty years, from the time he was born until the time when his mission began. They knew all about him, and about his honest and sound character and how he would never lie or do anything immoral or bad. They even used to call him Al-Amin (the Trustworthy One) from a young age, until his mission began, because they saw how truthful and honest he was. When Allah honored him with that which He honored him, they declared their enmity towards him and came up with all these accusations which any reasonable person would know he was innocent of. They were not sure what to accuse him of. Sometimes they said that he was a sorcerer, at other times they would say he was a poet, or crazy, or a liar. So Allah said:</p><p>انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.) (17:48) In response to their stubbornness, Allah says here:</p><p>قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Say: ""It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth"".) meaning, He has revealed the Qur'an which includes true information about the earlier and later generations, information which concurs with the realities of the past and future.</p><p>الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ</p><p>(Who knows the secret) means, Allah is the One Who knows the unseen in the heavens and on the earth; He knows their secrets just as He knows what is visible therein.</p><p>إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an invitation to them to repent and turn back to Allah, telling them that His mercy is vast and His patience is immense. Whoever repents to Him, He accepts his repentance. Despite all their lies, immorality, falsehood, disbelief and stubbornness, and saying what they said about the Messenger and the Qur'an, He still invites them to repent and give up their sin, and to come to Islam and true guidance. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَـلِثُ ثَلَـثَةٍ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِلاَّ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ وَإِن لَّمْ يَنتَهُواْ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ - أَفَلاَ يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ""Allah is the third of the three."" But there is no god but One God. And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them. Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (5:73-74)</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُواْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُوبُواْ فَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ الْحَرِيقِ</p><p>(Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women, and then do not turn in repentance, then they will have the torment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the burning Fire.) (85:10) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: ""Look at this kindness and generosity! They killed His friends and He is calling them to repentance and mercy.""</p>"

Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: ""A man will be dragged towards Hell, which will be expanding and contracting, and Ar-Rahman will say to it: `What is the matter with you' It will say: `He is seeking refuge from me.' So Allah will say, `Let My servant go.' Another man will be dragged towards Hell and he will say, `O Lord, I never expected this from You.' Allah will say, `What did you expect' The man will say, `I expected that Your mercy would be great enough to include me.' So Allah will say, `Let My servant go.'

Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ</div><p>(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ ءَايَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَـقُهُمْ لَهَا خَـضِعِينَ </div><p>(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضِينَ </div><p>(And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يحَسْرَةً عَلَى الْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ</div><p>(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَـؤُا مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ</div><p>(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً</div><p>(Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</div><p>(And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">الرَّحِيمِ</div><p>(the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: ""He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him."" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: ""He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.""</p>"

Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ </div><p>(And when your Lord called Musa: ""Go to the people who are wrongdoers. The people of Fir`awn. Will they not have Taqwa"" He said: ""My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will deny me, And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me."") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى </div><p>(Musa said: ""O my Lord! Open for me my chest. And ease my task for me."") (20:25-26) until:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa!)

Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً</div><p>(Allah said: ""We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power) meaning, proof;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ</div><p>(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our signs, you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors) (28:35),</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَاذْهَبَا بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ</div><p>(Go you both with Our signs. Verily, We shall be with you, listening.) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى</div><p>(I am with you both, hearing and seeing) (20:46). Meaning, `I will be with you by My protection, care, support and help.'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولا إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(And go both of you to Fir`awn, and say: `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the all that exists.') This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord) (20:47). which means, `both of us have been sent to you,'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ </div><p>(So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.) Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him. Saying:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً</div><p>(Did we not bring you up among us as a child) meaning, we brought you up among us, in our home and on our bed, we nourished you and did favors for you for many years, and after all that you responded to our kindness in this manner: you killed one of our men and denied our favors to you.' So he said to him:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَنتَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً</div><p>((Musa) said: ""I did it then..."") meaning, at that time,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَنَاْ مِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ</div><p>(when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِى رَبِّى حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِى مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ </div><p>(So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm, and made me one of the Messengers.) means, `the first situation came to an end and another took its place. Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَىَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ </div><p>(And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'</p>"

3166,"<h2>The Story of Musa and the End of Fir`awn</h2><p>Here Allah tells His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about what happened to Musa, peace be upon him, how Allah chose him, spoke with him and gave him mighty, dazzling signs and overwhelming proof, and sent him to Fir`awn and his people, but they denied the proof, disbelieved in him and arrogantly refused to follow him. Allah says:</p><p>إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لاًّهْلِهِ</p><p>(when Musa said to his household), meaning, remember when Musa was traveling with his family and lost his way. This was at night, in the dark. Musa had seen a fire beside the mountain, i.e., he had noticed a fire burning brightly, and said,</p><p>لاًّهْلِهِ إِنِّى آنَسْتُ نَاراً سَـَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ</p><p>(to his household: ""Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information..."") meaning, `about the way we should take.'</p><p>أَوْ ءَاتِيكُمْ بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</p><p>(or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves.) meaning, so that they could keep warm. And it was as he said: ""He came back with great news, and a great light."" Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(But when he came to it, he was called: ""Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it!"") meaning, when he came to it, he saw a great and terrifying sight: the fire was burning in a green bush, and the fire was burning ever brighter while the bush was growing ever more green and beautiful. Then he raised his head, and saw that its light was connected to the clouds of the sky. Ibn `Abbas and others said, ""It was not a fire, rather it was shining light."" According to one report narrated from Ibn `Abbas, it was the Light of the Lord of the worlds. Musa stood amazed by what he was seeing, and</p><p>نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ</p><p>(he was called: ""Blessed is whosoever is in the fire..."") Ibn `Abbas said, ""This means, Holy is (whosoever is in the fire).""</p><p>وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(and whosoever is round about it) means, of the angels. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and Qatadah.</p><p>وَسُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists), Who does whatever He wills and there is nothing like Him among His creation. Nothing He has made can encompass Him, and He is the Exalted, the Almighty, Who is utterly unlike all that He has created. Heaven and earth cannot contain Him, but He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who is far above any comparison with His creation.</p><p>يمُوسَى إِنَّهُ أَنَا اللَّهُ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Allah told him that the One Who was addressing him was his Lord Allah, the All-Mighty, Who has subjugated and subdued all things, the One Who is Wise in all His words and deeds. Then He commanded him to throw down the stick that was in his hand, so that He might show him clear proof that He is the One Who is able to do all things, whatever He wills. When Musa threw that stick down, it changed into the form of a huge and terrifying snake, moving quickly despite its size. Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ</p><p>(But when he saw it moving as if it were a Jann (snake).) Jann refers to a type of snake that is the fastest-moving and most agile. When Musa saw that with his own eyes,</p><p>وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</p><p>(he turned in flight, and did not look back.) meaning, he did not turn around, because he was so afraid. Allah's saying:</p><p>يمُوسَى لاَ تَخَفْ إِنِّى لاَ يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ الْمُرْسَلُونَ</p><p>(O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me.) means, `do not be afraid of what you see, for I want to choose you as a Messenger and make you a great Prophet.'</p><p>إَلاَّ مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْناً بَعْدَ سُوءٍ فَإِنِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an exception of the exclusionary type. This is good news for mankind, for whoever does an evil deed then gives it up and repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance, as He says:</p><p>وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحَاً ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes and does righteous good deeds, and then Ahtada.) (20:82)</p><p>وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ</p><p>(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself...) (4:110). And there are many other Ayat which say the same.</p><p>وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</p><p>(And put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without hurt.) This is another sign, further brilliant proof of the ability of Allah to do whatever He wills. It is also confirmation of the truth of the one to whom the miracle was given. Allah commanded him to put his hand into the opening of his garment, and when he put his hand in and took it out again, it came out white and shining as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of dazzling lightning.</p><p>فِى تِسْعِ ءَايَـتٍ</p><p>(among the nine signs) means, `these are two of the nine signs which you will be supported with and which will serve as proof for you. '</p><p>إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(to Fir`awn and his people. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious.) These were the nine signs of which Allah said:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى تِسْعَ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ</p><p>(And indeed We gave Musa nine clear signs) (17:101) -- as we have stated there.</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَـتُنَا مُبْصِرَةً</p><p>(But when Our Ayat came to them, clear to see,), i.e., clear and obvious,</p><p>قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(they said: ""This is a manifest magic"".) They wanted to oppose it with their own magic, but they were defeated and were returned disgraced.</p><p>وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا</p><p>(And they belied them) means, verbally,</p><p>وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ</p><p>(though they themselves were convinced thereof.) means, they knew deep down that this was truth from Allah, but they denied it and were stubborn and arrogant.</p><p>ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً</p><p>(wrongfully and arrogantly) means, wronging themselves because this was the despicable manner to which they were accustomed, and they were arrogant because they were too proud to follow the truth. Allah said:</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</p><p>(So, see what was the end of the mischief-makers.) meaning, `see, O Muhammad, what were the consequences of their actions when Allah destroyed them and drowned every last one of them in a single morning.' The point of this story is: beware, `O you who disbelieve in Muhammad ﷺ and deny the Message that he has brought from his Lord, lest the same thing that befell them befall you also.' But what is worse, is that Muhammad ﷺ is nobler and greater than Musa, and his proof is stronger than that of Musa, for the signs that Allah has given him are combined with his presence and his character, in addition to the fact that previous Prophets foretold his coming and took a covenant from the people that they would follow him if they should see him, may the best of blessings and peace from his Lord be upon him.</p>"

Then Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ عَلاَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Verily, Fir`awn exalted himself in the land) means, he was an arrogant oppressor and tyrant.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ أَهْلَهَا شِيَعاً</p><p>(and made its people Shiya`) means, he made them into different classes, each of which he used to do whatever he wanted of the affairs of his state.</p><p>يَسْتَضْعِفُ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(weakening a group among them. ) This refers to the Children of Israel, who at that time were the best of people, even though this tyrant king overpowered them, using them to do the most menial work and forcing them to hard labor night and day for him and his people. At the same time, he was killing their sons and letting their daughters live, to humiliate them and because he feared that there might appear among them the boy who would be the cause of his destruction and the downfall of his kingdom. So Fir`awn took precautions against that happening, by ordering that all boys born to the Children of Israel should be killed, but this precaution did not protect him against the divine decree, because when the term of Allah comes, it cannot be delayed, and for each and every matter there is a decree from Allah. Allah says:</p><p>وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land,) until His saying;</p><p>يَحْذَرُونَ</p><p>(which they feared.) And Allah did indeed do this to them, as He says:</p><p>وَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ</p><p>(And We made the people who were considered weak) until His saying;</p><p>يَعْرِشُونَ</p><p>(they erected) (7:137). And Allah said:</p><p>كَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَـهَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(Thus and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them) (26: 59). Fir`awn hoped that by his strength and power he would be saved from Musa, but that did not help him in the slightest. Despite his great power as a king he could not oppose the decree of Allah, which can never be overcome. On the contrary, Allah's ruling was carried out, for it had been written and decreed from past eternity that Fir`awn would meet his doom at the hands of Musa.</p>"

3259,"<h2>How Musa's Mother was inspired and shown what to do</h2><p>It was mentioned that when Fir`awn killed so many of the males of the Children of Israel, the Copts were scared that the Children of Israel would die out, and they themselves would have to do the heavy labor that the Children of Israel used to do. So they said to Fir`awn, ""If this continues, and their old men die and the young men are killed, their women will not be able to do the work that the men are doing, and we will end up having to do it."" So Fir`awn issued orders that the boys should be killed one year, and left alone the following year. Harun, peace be upon him, was born in a year when the boys were not killed, and Musa was born in a year when the boys were being killed. Fir`awn had people who were entrusted with this task. There were midwives who would go around and check on the women, and if they noticed that any woman was pregnant, they would write her name down. When the time came for her to give birth, no one was allowed to attend her except for Coptic women. If the woman gave birth to a girl, they would leave her alone and go away, but if she gave birth to a boy, the killers would come in with their sharp knives and kill the child, then they would go away; may Allah curse them. When the mother of Musa became pregnant with him, she did not show any signs of pregnancy as other women did, and none of the midwives noticed. But when she gave birth to a boy, she became very distressed and did not know what to do with him. She was extremely scared for him, because she loved him very much. No one ever saw Musa, peace be upon him, but they loved him, and the blessed ones were those who loved him both as a natural feeling and because he was a Prophet. Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى</div><p>(And I endued you with love from Me) (20:39).</p><h2>Musa, peace be upon him, in the House of Fir`awn</h2><p>When Musa's mother became so worried and confused, it was inspired into her heart and mind what she should do, as Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى أُمِّ مُوسَى أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِى اليَمِّ وَلاَ تَخَافِى وَلاَ تَحْزَنِى إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَـعِلُوهُ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ </div><p>(And We inspired the mother of Musa (telling): ""Suckle him, but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of (Our) Messengers."") Her house was on the banks of the Nile, so she took a box and made it into a cradle, and started to nurse her child. When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features. Allah filled her heart with love for him when she saw him; this was because she was blessed and because Allah wanted to honor her and cause her husband's doom. Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَالْتَقَطَهُ ءَالُ فِرْعَوْنَ لِيَكُونَ لَهُمْ عَدُوّاً وَحَزَناً</div><p>(Then the household of Fir`awn picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief.) Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَـمَـنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا كَانُواْ خَـطِئِينَ</div><p>(Verily, Fir`awn, Haman and their armies were sinners.)</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَقَالَتِ امْرَأَتُ فِرْعَوْنَ قُرَّةُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ</div><p>(And the wife of Fir`awn said: ""A comfort of the eye for me and for you..."") means, when Fir`awn saw him, he wanted to kill him, fearing that he was one of the Children of Israel. But his wife Asiyah bint Muzahim came to the child's defence and tried to endear him to Fir`awn, saying,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُرَّةُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ</div><p>(A comfort of the eye for me and for you.) Fir`awn said: ""For you he may be, but not for me.

3262,"<h2>The intense Grief of Musa's Mother, and how He was returned to Her</h2><p>Allah tells us how, when her child was lost in the river, the heart of Musa's mother became empty, i.e., she could not think of any matter in this world except Musa. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu `Ubaydah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِى بِهِ</div><p>(She was very near to disclose his (case),) means, because of the intensity of her grief, she almost told people that she had lost a son. She would have disclosed her situation, if Allah had not given her strength and patience. Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَوْلا أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَى قَلْبِهَا لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَوَقَالَتْ لأُخْتِهِ قُصِّيهِ</div><p>(had We not strengthened her heart, so that she might remain as one of the believers. And she said to his sister: ""Follow him."") means, she told her daughter, who was older and was of an age to understand things,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُصِّيهِ</div><p>(Follow him.) means, follow his traces and look for information about him, try to find out about him around the city. So she went out to do that.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَبَصُرَتْ بِهِ عَن جُنُبٍ</div><p>(So she watched him from a far place (secretly),) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Off to the side."" Mujahid said, ""It means she looked from afar. Qatadah said: ""She started to look at him as if she was not really interested."" When Musa had settled into the house of Fir`awn, after the king's wife had begun to love him and asked Fir`awn not to kill him, they brought to him the wet nurses who were to be found in their household, and he did not accept any of them, refusing to take milk from them. So they took him out to the marketplace, hoping to find a woman who would be suitable to nurse him. When (his sister) saw him in their arms, she recognized him, but she did not give any indication nor did they suspect her. Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ الْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(And We had already forbidden foster suckling mothers for him,) Because of his honored status with Allah, it was forbidden by divine decree. It was decreed that no one should nurse him except his own mother, and Allah caused this to be the means reuniting him with his mother so that she could nurse him and feel safe after having felt such fear. When his sister saw that they were confused over who should nurse the child,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَـصِحُونَ</div><p>(she said: ""Shall I direct you to a household who will rear him for you, and look after him in a good manner"") Ibn `Abbas said: When she said that, they had some doubts about her, so they seized her and asked her, How do you know these people will be sincere and will care for him"" She said to them, ""They will be sincere and will care for him because they want the king to be happy and because they hope for some reward."" So they let her go. After what she said, being safe from their harm, they took her to their house and brought the baby to his mother. She gave him her breast and he accepted it, so they rejoiced and sent the glad tidings to the wife of Fir`awn. She called for Musa's mother, treating her kindly and rewarding her generously. She did not realize that she was his real mother, but she saw that the baby accepted her breast. Then Asiyah asked her to stay with her and nurse the baby, but she refused, saying, ""I have a husband and children, and I cannot stay with you, but if you would like me to nurse him in my own home, I will do that."" The wife of Fir`awn agreed to that, and paid her a regular salary and gave her extra gifts and clothing and treated her kindly. The mother of Musa came back with her child, happy that after a time of fear Allah granted her security, prestige, and ongoing provision. There was only a short time between the distress and the way out, a day and night, or thereabouts -- and Allah knows best. Glory be to the One in Whose hands are all things; what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. He is the One Who grants those who fear Him, a way out from every worry and distress, Allah said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَرَدَدْنَـهُ إِلَى أُمِّهِ كَىْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُهَا</div><p>(So We restored him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted,) means, by him,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ تَحْزَنْ</div><p>(and that she might not grieve, ) means, for him.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلِتَعْلَمَ أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ</div><p>(and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true.) meaning, `We had promised her to return him to her and to make him one of the Messengers.' When he was returned to her, she realized that he was one of the Messengers, so as she brought him up, she treated him both as a child (with kindness) and as a Messenger (with respect).</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But most of them know not.) means, they do not know the wisdom of Allah in His actions and their good consequences, for which He is to be praised in this world and the Hereafter. For a thing may happen that people do not like, but its consequences are good, as Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَى أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you) (2:216).</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْراً كَثِيراً</div><p>(it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good) (4:19).</p>"

All the Imams of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are agreed on this. This is the view of Ibn `Abbas and others concerning phrases such as the Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ</div><p>(only that We know) (2:143).

It is Allah Who will gather you with the group of the righteous, not with the group of your parents, even though you were the closest of people to them in the world.

Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يِقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ فَإِذَآ أُوذِىَ فِى اللَّهِ جَعَلَ فِتْنَةَ النَّاسِ كَعَذَابِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Of mankind are some who say: ""We believe in Allah."" But if they are made to suffer for Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as Allah's punishment;) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Meaning that their trial is leaving Islam if they are made to suffer for Allah."" This was also the view of others among the Salaf. This Ayah is like the Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انْقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ</div><p>(And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge: if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face...) until:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ذلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلَـلُ الْبَعِيدُ</div><p>(That is a straying far away) 22:11-12. Then Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَئِنْ جَآءَ نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ</div><p>(and if victory comes from your Lord, they will say: ""Verily, we were with you."") meaning, ""if victory comes from your Lord, O Muhammad, and there are spoils of war, these people will say to you, `We were with you,' i.e., we are your brothers in faith."" This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">الَّذِينَ يَتَرَبَّصُونَ بِكُمْ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ فَتْحٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ قَالُواْ أَلَمْ نَكُنْ مَّعَكُمْ وَإِن كَانَ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ نَصِيبٌ قَالُواْ أَلَمْ نَسْتَحْوِذْ عَلَيْكُمْ وَنَمْنَعْكُمْ مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(Those who wait and watch about you; if you gain a victory from Allah, they say: ""Were we not with you"" But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): ""Did we not gain mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers"") (4:141).</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَعَسَى اللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِالْفَتْحِ أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ فَيُصْبِحُواْ عَلَى مَآ أَسَرُّواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ نَـدِمِينَ</div><p>(Perhaps Allah may bring a victory or a decision according to His will. Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves) (5:52). And Allah tells us about them here:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَئِنْ جَآءَ نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ</div><p>(and if victory comes from your Lord, they will say: ""Verily, we were with you."") Then Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوَ لَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِمَا فِى صُدُورِ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the breasts of the creatures) meaning, `does Allah not know best what is in their hearts and what they store secretly within themselves, even though outwardly they may appear to be in agreement with you'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ </div><p>(And indeed Allah knows those who believe, and verily He knows the hypocrites.) Allah will test the people with calamities and with times of ease, so that He may distinguish the believers from the hypocrites, to see who will obey Allah both in times of hardship and of ease, and who will obey Him only when things are going in accordance with their desires. As Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّى نَعْلَمَ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَالصَّـبِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَ أَخْبَـرَكُمْ </div><p>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard and the patient, and We shall test your facts.) (47:31) After the battle of Uhud, with its trials and tribulations for the Muslims, Allah said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَّا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَى مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَمِيزَ الْخَبِيثَ مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ</div><p>(Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good...)

3410,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Foretelling the Victory of the Romans</h2><p>These Ayat were revealed about the victory of Sabur, the king of Persia, over Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), the adjoining partisan states of the Arabian Peninsula, and the outlying regions of the land of the Romans. Heraclius, the emperor of the Romans, was forced to flee to Constantinople where he was besieged for a lengthy period. Then Heraclius regained the upper hand. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on this Ayah:</p><p>الم - غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ - فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated. In the nearest land,) He said, ""They were defeated and then they were victorious."" He said, ""The idolators wanted the Persians to prevail over the Romans, because they were idol worshippers, and the Muslims wanted the Romans to prevail over the Persians, because they were People of the Book. This was mentioned to Abu Bakr, who mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَمَا إِنَّهُمْ سَيَغْلِبُون»</p><p>(They will certainly prevail.) Abu Bakr mentioned this to the idolators, and they said, ""Set a time limit for that, and if we prevail, we will get such and such; and if you prevail, you will get such and such."" So he set a limit of five years, and they (the Romans) did not prevail. Abu Bakr mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and he said:</p><p>«أَلَا جَعَلْتَهَا إِلَى دُونَ أُرَاهُ قَالَ: الْعَشْرِ »</p><p>(Why do you not make it less than) I (the narrator) think he meant less than ten. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: ""Bid` means less than ten."" Then the Romans were victorious, and he said, ""That is what Allah said:</p><p>الم - غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ - فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ- فِي بِضْعِ سِنِينَ لِلَّهِ الْأَمْرُ مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن بَعْدُ وَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَفْرَحُ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ - بِنَصْرِ اللَّهِ يَنصُرُ مَن يَشَاءُ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِي</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated. In the nearest land, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious. In Bid`i years. The decision of the matter, before and after is only with Allah. And on that day, the believers will rejoice -- with the help of Allah. He helps whom He wills, and He is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said: ""Hasan Gharib.""</p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Niyar bin Mukram Al-Aslami said: ""When the following Ayat were revealed:</p><p>الم - غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ - فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ - فِي بِضْعِ سِنِينَ لِلَّهِ الْأَمْرُ مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن بَعْدُ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated. In the nearest land, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious. In Bid` years.) on the day they were revealed, the Persians were prevailing over the Romans. The Muslims wanted the Romans to prevail over them (the Persians), because they were both people who followed a Book. Concerning this Allah said:</p><p>وَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَفْرَحُ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ - بِنَصْرِ اللَّهِ يَنصُرُ مَن يَشَاءُ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p>(And on that day, the believers will rejoice -- with the help of Allah. He helps whom He wills, and He is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) The Quraysh, on the other hand, wanted the Persians to prevail, because neither of them were people who followed a Book and neither of them believed in the Resurrection. When Allah revealed these Ayat, Abu Bakr went out proclaiming throughout Makkah:</p><p>الم - غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ - فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ - فِي بِضْعِ سِنِينَ لِلَّهِ الْأَمْرُ مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن بَعْدُ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated. In the nearest land, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious. In Bid` years.) Some of the Quraysh said to Abu Bakr: `This is (a bet) between us and you. Your companion claims that the Romans will defeat the Persians within three to nine years, so why not have a bet on that between us and you' Abu Bakr said, `Yes.' This was before betting had been forbidden. So, Abu Bakr and the idolators made a bet, and they said to Abu Bakr: `What do you think, Bid` means something between three and nine years, so let us agree on the middle.' So they agreed on six years. Then six years passed without the Romans being victorious, so the idolators took what they had bet with Abu Bakr. When the seventh year came and the Romans were finally victorious over the Persians, the Muslims rebuked Abu Bakr for agreeing on six years. He said: `Because Allah said: ""In Bid` years.""' At that time, many people became Muslim."" This is how it was narrated by At-Tirmidhi, then he said, ""This is a Hasan Hadith.""</p><h2>Who were the Romans</h2><p>الم - غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ - فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated.) We have already discussed the separate letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs in the beginning of our Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah. With regard to the Romans (Ar-Rum), they are the descendents of Al-`Iys bin Ishaq bin Ibrahim. They are the cousins of the Children of Isra'il, and are also known as Bani Al-Asfar. They used to followed the religion of the Greeks, who were descendents of Yafith bin Nuh, the cousins of the Turks. They used to worship the seven planets, and they prayed facing the direction of the North Pole. It is they who founded Damascus and built its temple in which there is a prayer niche facing north. The Romans followed this religion until approximately three hundred years after the time of the Messiah. The king who ruled Greater Syria along with the Fertile Crescent (semicircle of fertile land from Syrian Desert to Persian Gulf) was called Caesar. The first of them to enter the Christian religion was Constantine the son of Costas, whose mother was Maryam Al-Hilaniyyah Ash-Shadqaniyyah, from the land of Harran. She had become Christian before him, and she invited him to her religion. Before that he had been a philosopher, then he followed her. It was said that this was merely an outward show of belief. Then the Christians met with him. During his time they debated with `Abdullah bin Ariyus (Arius) and great differences arose which could not be reconciled. Then a gathering of three hundred and eighteen bishops reached an agreement, and presented their creed to Constantine. This is what they call the Great Trust, but in fact it is the Worst Betrayal. They presented to him their laws, i.e., books of rulings on what was lawful and prohibited, and other things that they needed. They changed the religion of the Messiah (peace be upon him), adding some things and taking some things away. They began praying towards the East, and changed the Sabbath (Saturday) rites to Sunday. They worshipped the cross, permitted eating of pigs, adopted innovated observances such as the festival of the cross, Mass, baptism, etc., Palm Sunday and other occasions. They appointed a pope, as their leader, and patriarchs, metropolitans, bishops, priests and deacons, and they invented monasticism. The king built churches and places of worship for them, and he founded the city which is named after him, Constantinople. It was said that during his time twelve thousand churches were built, three places of prayer in Bethlehem, and that his mother built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. These are the ones who followed the religion of the kings. Then after them came the Jacobites, followers of Ya`qub Al-Askaf, then the Nestorians, the followers of Nestorius. There are many groups and sects among them, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ افْتَرَقُوا عَلَى اثْنَتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَة»</p><p>(They split into seventy two sects.) The point here is that they continued to follow Christianity. Every time one Caesar died, another succeeded him, until the last of them, Heraclius, came to power. He was a wise man, one of the most astute and intelligent of kings, who had deep insight and well-formed opinions. His was a great and glorious reign. He was opposed by Chosroes, the king of Persia and of regions such as Iraq, Khurasan, Ar-Riy and all the lands of the Persians. His name was Sabur Dhul-Aktaf, and his kingdom was greater than the kingdom of Caesar. He was the leader of the Persians and was as stubborn as the Persians who were Zoroastrian fire worshippers.</p><h2>How Caesar defeated Chosroes (Kisra)</h2><p>It was previously reported that `Ikrimah said: ""Chosroes sent his deputy and his army against Caesar, and they fought."" It is well-known that Chosroes himself fought in the army that invaded his land, and he defeated Caesar and overwhelmed him until he had nothing left except the city of Constantinople, where Chosroes besieged him for a long time, until things became very difficult for him. He was highly venerated among the Christians, and Chosroes was not able to conquer the city because it was well fortified, and half of it faced the land while the other half faced the sea, from where supplies were able to reach them. After this had gone on for a long time, Caesar thought of a clever trick. He asked Chosroes to let him leave his city in return for money given as a peace-offering, on whatever terms he (Chosroes) wanted. Chosroes agreed to that and asked for a huge amount of wealth -- gold, jewels, fabric, servant-women, servants, and much more -- such that no king on earth could ever pay. Caesar went along with that and gave him the impression that he had all that he had asked for, although he thought he was crazy for asking for such a thing, because even if the two of them were to combine all of their wealth, it would not amount to even one-tenth of that. He asked Chosroes to let him go out of the city to Ash-Sham and the other regions of his kingdom, so that he could gather that from his storehouses and places where his wealth was buried. Chosroes let him go, and when Caesar was about to leave Constantinople, he gathered his people together and told them: ""I am going out on a mission I have decided to do so with some soldiers I have selected from my army; if I come back to you before one year passes, I will still be your king but if I do not come back after that, you will have the choice. Then, if you wish, you may remain loyal to me, or if you wish you may appoint someone instead of me. Signs of Tawhid Allah tells us that pondering His creation will show that He exists and that He is Unique in creating it, and that there is no god nor lord besides Him. So He says:</p>"

Yet despite all that, when their Messengers came to them with clear signs, while they were enjoying their life of luxury, Allah punished them for their sins and they had no one who could protect them from Allah. Their wealth and sons could not protect them from the wrath of Allah in the slightest, and Allah was not at all unjust towards them when He sent His punishment upon them.</p><p>وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ</p><p>(9. cont - but they used to wrong themselves.)

It was said that what is meant by the words</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَشْتَرِى لَهْوَ الْحَدِيثِ</div><p>(purchases idle talks) is buying singing servant girls. Ibn Jarir said that it means all speech that hinders people from seeing the signs of Allah and following His path.

In some reports he (the angel of death) is called `Izra'il, which is well known. This is the view of Qatadah and others. The angel of death has helpers.

3537,"<h2>Abolition of Adoption</h2><p>Before Allah discusses ideas and theoretical matters, He gives tangible examples: one man cannot have two hearts in his body, and a man's wife does not become his mother if he says the words of Zihar to her: ""You are to me like the back of my mother."" By the same token, an adopted child does not become the son of the man who adopts him and calls him his son. Allah says:</p><p>مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِى جَوْفِهِ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَزْوَجَكُمُ اللاَّئِى تُظَـهِرُونَ مِنْهُنَّ أُمَّهَـتِكُمْ</p><p>(Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body. Neither has He made your wives whom you declare to be like your mothers' backs, your real mothers...)

This was revealed concerning Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Prophet . The Prophet had adopted him before prophethood, and he was known as Zayd bin Muhammad. Allah wanted to put an end to this naming and attribution, as He said:</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَآءَكُمْ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ</p><p>(nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. ) This is similar to the Ayah later in this Surah:</p><p>مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَآ أَحَدٍ مّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَـكِن رَّسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيماً</p><p>(Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the last (end) of the Prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything.) (33:40). And Allah says here:</p><p>ذَلِكُمْ قَوْلُكُم بِأَفْوَهِكُمْ</p><p>(That is but your saying with your mouths.) meaning, `your adoption of him is just words, and it does not mean that he is really your son,' for he was created from the loins of another man, and a child cannot have two fathers just as a man cannot have two hearts in one body.</p><p>وَاللَّهُ يَقُولُ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِى السَّبِيلَ</p><p>(But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the way.) Sa`id bin Jubayr said:</p><p>يَقُولُ الْحَقَّ</p><p>(But Allah says the truth,) means, justice. Qatadah said:</p><p>وَهُوَ يَهْدِى السَّبِيلَ</p><p>(and He guides to the way) means, the straight path. Imam Ahmad said that Hasan told them that Zuhayr told them from Qabus, meaning Ibn Abi Zibyan, that his father told him: ""I said to Ibn `Abbas, `Do you know the Ayah,</p><p>مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِى جَوْفِهِ</p><p>(Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body.) What does this mean' He said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up one day to pray, and he trembled. The hypocrites who were praying with him said, `Do you not see that he has two hearts, one heart with you and another with them' Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِى جَوْفِهِ</p><p>(Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body.)"" This was also narrated by At-Tirmidhi, who said, ""It is a Hasan Hadith"". It was also narrated by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from the Hadith of Zuhayr.</p><h2>An Adopted Child should be named after His Real Father</h2><p>ادْعُوهُمْ لاًّبَآئِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Call them (adopted sons) by their fathers, that is more just with Allah.) This is a command which abrogates the state of affairs that existed at the beginning of Islam, when it was permitted to call adopted sons after the man who adopted them. Then Allah commanded that they should be given back the names of their real fathers, and states that this was more fair and just. Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said: ""Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, was always called Zayd bin Muhammad, until (the words of the) Qur'an were revealed:</p><p>ادْعُوهُمْ لاًّبَآئِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.)"" This was also narrated by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. They used to deal with them as sons in every respect, including being alone with them as Mahrams and so on. Hence Sahlah bint Suhayl, the wife of Abu Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: ""O Messenger of Allah! We used to call Salim our son, but Allah has revealed what He has revealed. He used to enter upon me, but I feel that Abu Hudhayfah does not like that. The Prophet said:</p><p>«أَرْضِعِيهِ تَحْرُمِي عَلَيْه»</p><p>(Breastfeed him and he will become your Mahram. )"" Hence when this ruling was abrogated, Allah made it permissible for a man to marry the ex-wife of his adopted son, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ married Zaynab bint Jahsh, the divorced wife of Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, Allah said:</p><p>لِكَىْ لاَ يَكُونَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ حَرَجٌ فِى أَزْوَاجِ أَدْعِيَآئِهِمْ إِذَا قَضَوْاْ مِنْهُنَّ وَطَراً</p><p>(So that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them) (33:37). And Allah says in Ayat At-Tahrim:</p><p>وَحَلَـئِلُ أَبْنَآئِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَـبِكُمْ</p><p>(The wives of your sons from your own loins) (4:23). The wife of an adopted son is not included because he was not born from the man's loins. A ""foster"" son through breastfeeding is the same as a son born from one's own loins, from the point of view of Shari`ah, because the Prophet said in the Two Sahihs:</p><p>«حَرَّمُوا مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ مَا يُحَرَّمُ مِنَ النَّسَب»</p><p>(Suckling makes unlawful as lineage does.) As for calling a person ""son"" as an expression of honor and endearment, this is not what is forbidden in this Ayah, as is indicated by the report recorded by Imam Ahmad and the Sunan compilers -- apart from At-Tirmidhi -- from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""We young boys of Banu `Abd Al-Muttalib came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at the Jamarat; he slapped us on the thigh and said,</p><p>«(أُبَيْنِيَّ) لَا تَرْمُوا الْجَمْرَةَ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْس»</p><p>(O my sons, do not stone the Jamarah until the sun has risen.) This was during the Farewell Pilgrimage in 10 AH.</p><p>ادْعُوهُمْ لاًّبَآئِهِمْ</p><p>(Call them by their fathers.) This is concerning Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him. He was killed in 8 AH at the battle of Mu'tah. In Sahih Muslim it is reported that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَابَنِي»</p><p>(O my son.)"" It was also reported by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi.</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَعْلَمُواْ ءَابَاءَهُمْ فَإِخوَانُكُمْ فِى الدِّينِ وَمَوَلِيكُمْ</p><p>(But if you know not their father's then they are your brothers in the religion and Mawalikum (your freed servants).) Here Allah commands that adopted sons should be given back their fathers' names, if they are known; if they are not known, then they should be called brothers in faith or freed servants, to compensate for not knowing what their real lineage is. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ left Makkah after performing his `Umrat Al-Qada', the daughter of Hamzah, may Allah be pleased with her, started following him, calling, ""O uncle, O uncle!"" `Ali took her and said to Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with her, ""Take care of your uncle's daughter,"" so she picked her up. `Ali, Zayd and Ja`far -- may Allah be pleased with them -- disputed over of which of them was going to take care of her, and each of them gave his reasons. `Ali said, ""I have more right, because she is the daughter of my paternal uncle."" Zayd said, ""She is the daughter of my brother."" Ja`far bin Abi Talib said: ""She is the daughter of my paternal uncle and I am married to her maternal aunt -- meaning Asma' bint `Umays."" The Prophet ruled that she should stay with her maternal aunt, and said:</p><p>«الْخَالَةُ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الْأُم»</p><p>(The maternal aunt has the same status as the mother.) He said to `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him,</p><p>«أَنْتَ مِنِّي وَأَنَا مِنْك»</p><p>(You belong to me and I belong to you.) He said to Ja`far, may Allah be pleased with him,</p><p>«أَشْبَهْتَ خَلْقِي وَخُلُقِي»</p><p>(You resemble me both in your looks and in your attitude.) And he said to Zayd, may Allah be pleased with him,</p><p>«أَنْتَ أَخُونَا وَمَوْلَانَا»</p><p>(You are our brother and our freed servant.) This Hadith contains a number of rulings, the most important of which is that the Prophet ruled according to the truth, and that he sought to appease all the disputing parties. His saying to Zayd, may Allah be pleased with him,</p><p>«أَنْتَ أَخُونَا وَمَوْلَانَا»</p><p>(You are our brother and our freed servant.) is as Allah says in this Ayah:</p><p>فَإِخوَانُكُمْ فِى الدِّينِ وَمَوَلِيكُمْ</p><p>(your brothers in faith and your freed servants. ) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَآ أَخْطَأْتُمْ بِهِ</p><p>(And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake,) meaning, if you call one of them after someone who is not in fact his father, by mistake, after trying your best to find out his parentage, then Allah will not attach any sin to this mistake. This is like the Ayah in which Allah commands His servants to say:</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا</p><p>(Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error) (2:286). It was reported in Sahih Muslim that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: قَدْ فَعَلْت»</p><p>(Allah says, ""Certainly I did (so)."") In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it was recorded that `Amr bin Al-`As, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا اجْتَهَدَ الْحَاكِمُ فَأَصَابَ فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَإِنِ اجْتَهَدَ فَأَخْطَأَ فَلَهُ أَجْر»</p><p>(If the judge makes Ijtihad and reaches the right decision, he will have two rewards; if he makes Ijtihad and reaches the wrong decision, he will have one reward.) In another Hadith:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى رَفَعَ عَنْ أُمَّتِي الْخَطَأَ وَالنِّسْيَانَ وَمَا يُكْرَهُونَ عَلَيْه»</p><p>(Allah will forgive my Ummah for mistakes, forgetfulness and what they are forced to do.) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَآ أَخْطَأْتُمْ بِهِ وَلَـكِن مَّا تَعَمَّدَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) meaning, the sin is on the person who deliberately does something wrong, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>لاَّ يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ اللَّهُ بِالَّلغْوِ فِى أَيْمَـنِكُمْ</p><p>(Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths) (2:225). Imam Ahmad narrated from Ibn `Abbas that `Umar said: ""Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with the Truth and revealed to him the Book. One of the things that was revealed in it was the Ayah of stoning, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stoned adulterers and we stoned them after he died."" Then he said, ""We also used to recite, `Do not attribute yourselves to anyone other than your fathers, for this is disbelief, to attribute yourselves to anyone other than your fathers.""' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تُطْرُونِي كَمَا أُطْرِيَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ، فَإِنَّمَا أَنَا عَبْدُاللهِ، فَقُولُوا: عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(Do not exaggerate in praising me as `Isa bin Maryam was praised upon him be peace and blessings. I am just a servant of Allah. Say, ""He is His servant and Messenger."") Or Ma`mar may have said:</p><p>«كَمَا أَطْرَتِ النَّصَارَى ابْنَ مَرْيَم»</p><p>(As the Christians praised the son of Maryam. ) This was also narrated in another Hadith:</p><p>«ثَلَاثٌ فِي النَّاسِ كُفْرٌ: الطَّعْنُ فِي النَّسَبِ، وَالنِّيَاحَةُ عَلَى الْمَيِّتِ، وَالْاسْتِسْقَاءُ بِالنُّجُوم»</p><p>(Three things that people do are parts of disbelief: slandering a person's lineage, wailing over the dead and seeking rain by the stars.)</p>"

3539,"<h2>Loyalty to the Prophet ; and his wives are Mothers of the Believers</h2><p>Allah tells us how His Messenger is merciful and sincere towards his Ummah, and how he is closer to them than they are to themselves. His judgement or ruling takes precedence over their own choices for themselves, as Allah says:</p><p>فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّى يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَجِدُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجاً مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً</p><p>(But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept with full submission.) (4:65) In the Sahih it says:</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يُؤْمِنُ أَحَدُكُمْ حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ وَمَالِهِ وَوَلَدِهِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِين»</p><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, none of you truly believes until I am dearer to him than his own self, his wealth, his children and all the people.) It was also reported in the Sahih that `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ""O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, you are dearer to me than everything except myself."" He said,</p><p>«لَا، يَا عُمَرُ حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ نَفْسِك»</p><p>(No, O `Umar, not until I am dearer to you than yourself.) `Umar said: ""O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, now you are dearer to me than everything, even myself."" He said,</p><p>«الْآنَ يَاعُمَر»</p><p>(Now, O `Umar you have got it right.) Allah says in this Ayah:</p><p>النَّبِىُّ أَوْلَى بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ</p><p>(The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves,) Concerning this Ayah, Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet said:</p><p>«مَا مِنْ مُؤْمِنٍ إِلَّا وَأَنَا أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِهِ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>النَّبِىُّ أَوْلَى بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ</p><p>(There is no believer except I am the closest of all people to him in this world and in the Hereafter. Recite, if you wish: (The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves.)</p><p>فَأَيُّمَا مُؤْمِنٍ تَرَكَ مَالًا فَلْيَرِثْهُ عُصْبَتُهُ مَنْ كَانُوا، وَإِنْ تَرَكَ دَيْنًا أَوْ ضِيَاعًا فَلْيَأْتِنِي فَأَنَا مَوْلَاه»</p><p>If any believer leaves behind any wealth, let his own relatives inherit it, but if he leaves behind any debt or orphans, bring them to me and I will take care of them.) This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, and he also recorded it in the Book of Loans.</p><p>وَأَزْوَجُهُ أُمَّهَـتُهُمْ</p><p>(and his wives are their mothers.) means, they are unlawful for marriage. In terms of honor, respect and veneration, it is not permissible for them to be alone with them, and the prohibition of marriage to them does not extend to their daughters and sisters, according to scholarly consensus.</p><p>وَأُوْلُو الاٌّرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَى بِبَعْضٍ فِى كِتَـبِ اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُهَـجِرِينَ</p><p>(And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the decree of Allah than the believers and the Muhajirin, ) This is an abrogation of the rule that existed previously, whereby they could inherit from one another by virtue of the oath of brotherhood among them. Ibn `Abbas and others said: ""A Muhajir would inherit from an Ansari even though they were not related by blood, because of the brotherhood established between them by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."" This was also stated by Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among scholars of the earlier and later generations.</p><p>إِلاَّ أَن تَفْعَلُواْ إِلَى أَوْلِيَآئِكُمْ مَّعْرُوفاً</p><p>(except that you do kindness to those brothers.) means, the idea of inheriting from one another has gone, but there remains the duty to offer support and kindness, to uphold ties of brotherhood and to offer good advice.</p><p>كَانَ ذلِك فِى الْكِتَـبِ مَسْطُورًا</p><p>(This has been written in the Book.) This ruling, which is that those who are blood relatives have closer personal ties to one another, is a ruling which Allah has decreed and which is written in the First Book which cannot be altered or changed. This is the view of Mujahid and others. (This is the case) even though Allah legislated something different at certain times, and there is wisdom behind this, for He knew that this would be abrogated and the original ruling that was instituted an eternity ago would prevail, and this is His universal and legislative decree. And Allah knows best.</p>"
3540,"<h2>The Covenant of the Prophets</h2><p>Allah tells us about the five Mighty Messengers with strong resolve and the other Prophets, how He took a covenant from them to establish the religion of Allah and convey His Message, and to cooperate and support one another, as Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَـبٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ قَالَ ءَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَى ذلِكُمْ إِصْرِى قَالُواْ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَاشْهَدُواْ وَأَنَاْ مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ الشَّـهِدِينَ </div><p>(And when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets, saying: ""Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah, and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him."" Allah said: ""Do you agree, and will you take up My covenant"" They said: ""We agree."" He said: ""Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses."") (3:81) This covenant was taken from them after their missions started. Elsewhere in the Qur'an, Allah mentions five by name, and these are the Mighty Messengers with strong resolve. They are also mentioned by name in this Ayah and in the Ayah:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ الِدِينِ مَا وَصَّى بِهِ نُوحاً وَالَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا وَصَّيْنَا بِهِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى أَنْ أَقِيمُواْ الدِّينَ وَلاَ تَتَفَرَّقُواْ فِيهِ</div><p>(He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it.) (42:13) This is the covenant which Allah took from them, as He says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَمِنْكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ</div><p>(And when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and `Isa son of Maryam.) This Ayah begins with the last Prophet, as a token of respect, may the blessings of Allah be upon him, then the names of the other Prophets are given in order, may the blessings of Allah be upon them. Ibn `Abbas said: ""The strong covenant is Al-`Ahd (the covenant).</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِّيَسْأَلَ الصَّـدِقِينَ عَن صِدْقِهِمْ</div><p>(That He may ask the truthful about their truth.)

We bear witness that the Messengers did indeed convey the Message of their Lord and advised their nations, and that they clearly showed them the truth in which there is no confusion, doubt or ambiguity, even though they were rejected by the ignorant, stubborn and rebellious wrongdoers. What the Messengers brought is the truth, and whoever opposes them is misguided. As the people of Paradise will say:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.) (7:43)</p>"
3541,
3542,"<h2>The Campaign of the Confederates (Al-Ahzab)</h2><p>Allah tells us of the blessings and favors He bestowed upon His believing servants when He diverted their enemies and defeated them in the year when they gathered together and plotted. That was the year of Al-Khandaq, in Shawwal of the year 5 AH according to the well-known correct view. Musa bin `Uqbah and others said that it was in the year 4 AH. The reason why the Confederates came was that a group of the leaders of the Jews of Banu Nadir, whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had expelled from Al-Madinah to Khaybar, including Sallam bin Abu Al-Huqayq, Sallam bin Mishkam and Kinanah bin Ar-Rabi`, went to Makkah where they met with the leaders of Quraysh and incited them to make war against the Prophet . They promised that they would give them help and support, and Quraysh agreed to that. Then they went to the Ghatafan tribe with the same call, and they responded too. The Quraysh came out with their company of men from various tribes and their followers, under the leadership of Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb. The Ghatafan were led by `Uyaynah bin Hisn bin Badr. In all they numbered nearly ten thousand. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ heard that they had set out, he commanded the Muslims to dig a ditch (Khandaq) around Al-Madinah from the east. This was on the advice of Salman Al-Farisi, may Allah be pleased with him. So the Muslims did this, working hard, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ worked with them, carrying earth away and digging, in the process of which there occurred many miracles and clear signs. The idolators came and made camp to the north of Al-Madinah, near Uhud, and some of them camped on the high ground overlooking Al-Madinah, as Allah says:</p><p>إِذْ جَآءُوكُمْ مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ</p><p>(When they came upon you from above you and from below you,) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came out with the believers, who numbered nearly three thousand, or it was said that they numbered seven hundred. They had their backs towards (the mountain of) Sal` and were facing the enemy, and the ditch, in which there was no water, was between the two groups, preventing the cavalry and infantry from reaching them. The women and children were in the strongholds of Al-Madinah. Banu Qurayzah, who were a group among the Jews, had a fortress in the south-east of Al-Madinah, and they had made a treaty with the Prophet and were under his protection. They numbered nearly eight hundred fighters. Huyay bin Akhtab An-Nadari went to them and kept trying to persuade them until they broke the treaty and went over to the side of the Confederates against the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The crisis deepened and things got worse, as Allah says:</p><p>هُنَالِكَ ابْتُلِىَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُواْ زِلْزَالاً شَدِيداً</p><p>(There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking.) 33: 11 They besieged the Prophet and his Companions for almost a month, but they did not reach them and there was no fighting between them, except for when `Amr bin `Abd Wadd Al-`Amiri, who was one of the most famous and bravest horsemen of the Jahiliyyah, came with some other horsemen, and crossed the ditch to the Muslim side. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ called for the Muslim cavalry, and it was said that no one came forward. Then he called `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, who came forward and they fought in single combat until Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, killed him, and this was a sign of imminent victory. Then Allah sent an intensely cold wind with strong gusts against the Confederates, and they were left with no tents or anything else; they could not light any fires or do anything, and so they departed, disappointed and defeated, as Allah says:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَآءَتْكُمْ جُنُودٌ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحاً وَجُنُوداً</p><p>(O you who believe! Remember Allah's favor to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces) Mujahid said: ""This was the easterly wind."" This view is supported by another Hadith:</p><p>«نُصِرْتُ بِالصَّبَا، وَأُهْلِكَتْ عَادٌ بِالدَّبُور»</p><p>(I was given victory by the easterly wind, and `Ad were destroyed by the westerly wind.)</p><p>وَجُنُوداً لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا</p><p>(and forces that you saw not.) This refers to the angels who shook them and cast fear and terror into their hearts. The chief of each tribe said, ""O Banu so-and-so, to me!"" So they gathered around him, and he said, ""Let us save ourselves,"" when Allah cast fear and terror into their hearts. In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Ibrahim At-Taymi said that his father said: ""We were with Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, may Allah be pleased with him, and a man said to him: `If I had met the Messenger of Allah ﷺ I would have fought alongside him and I would have striven my utmost.' Hudhayfah said to him: `Would you really have done that I was present with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during (the campaign) against the Confederates on a very cold and windy night, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَلَا رَجُلٌ يَأْتِي بِخَبَرِ الْقَوْمِ يَكُونُ مَعِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Is there any man who will bring me news of the people He will be with me on the Day of Resurrection.) None of us answered him, and he repeated it a second and a third time. Then he said:</p><p>«يَاحُذَيْفَةُ قُمْ فَأْتِنَا بِخَبَرٍ مِنَ الْقَوْم»</p><p>(O Hudhayfah, get up and bring us news of the people.) When he called me by name, I had no choice but to get up. He said,</p><p>«ائْتِنِي بِخَبَرِ الْقَوْمِ وَلَاتَذْعَرْهُمْ عَلَي»</p><p>(Bring us news of the people, but do not alarm them.) So I went, walking as if I were walking among pigeons, until I came to them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his back by the fire, and I put an arrow in my bow, wanting to shoot it at him, then I remembered what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَلَاتَذْعَرْهُمْ عَلَي»</p><p>(Do not alarm them.) If I shot the arrow, I would have hit him. So I came back, again walking as if I were walking among pigeons, and I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . After my returning I began to feel very cold. I told the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and he gave me to wear a spare cloak of his which he used to pray in. I slept until morning came, and when morning came, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«قُمْ يَانَوْمَان»</p><p>(Get up, O sleepy one!)""'</p><p>إِذْ جَآءُوكُمْ مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ</p><p>(When they came upon you from above you) refers to the Confederates,</p><p>وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ</p><p>(and from below you.) We have already noted the report from Abu Hudhayfah that these were Banu Qurayzah.</p><p>وَإِذْ زَاغَتِ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَبَلَغَتِ الْقُلُوبُ الْحَنَاجِرَ</p><p>(and when the eyes grew wild and the hearts reached to the throats,) means, from intense fear and terror.</p><p>وَتَظُنُّونَ بِاللَّهِ الظُّنُونَاْ</p><p>(and you were harboring doubts about Allah.) Ibn Jarir said: ""Some of those who were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, had doubts and thought that the outcome would be against the believers, and that Allah would allow that to happen."" Muhammad bin Ishaq said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَإِذْ زَاغَتِ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَبَلَغَتِ الْقُلُوبُ الْحَنَاجِرَ وَتَظُنُّونَ بِاللَّهِ الظُّنُونَاْ</p><p>(when the eyes grew wild and the hearts reached to the throats, and you were harboring doubts about Allah.) ""The believers had all kinds of doubts, and hypocrisy emerged to such an extent that Mu`attib bin Qushayr, the brother of Banu `Amr bin `Awf said: `Muhammad ﷺ was promising us that we would win the treasure of Chosroes and Caesar, but one of us cannot even go and relieve himself.""' Al-Hasan said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَتَظُنُّونَ بِاللَّهِ الظُّنُونَاْ</p><p>(and you were harboring doubts about Allah.) ""There were different kinds of thoughts; the hypocrites thought that Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions would be eliminated, while the believers were certain that what Allah and His Messenger promised was true, and that He would cause the religion to prevail even if the idolators hated it."" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ""On the day of Al-Khandaq, we said: `O Messenger of Allah, is there anything we should say, for our hearts have reached our throats' He said:</p><p>«نَعَمْ، قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ اسْتُرْ عَوْرَاتِنَا وَآمِنْ رَوْعَاتِنَا»</p><p>(Yes, say: O Allah, cover our weak points and calm our fears.) Then Allah struck the faces of the enemy with the wind, and defeated them with the wind. This was also recorded by Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal from Abu `Amir Al-`Aqadi.</p>"

3609,"<h2>The Hour will come so that each Person will be rewarded or punished in accordance with His Deeds</h2><p>This is one of three Ayat -- there is no fourth -- where Allah commands His Messenger to swear by His Almighty Lord that the resurrection will surely come, because the stubborn followers of disbelief denied that it would happen. One of these Ayat is in Surah Yunus, where Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ قُلْ إِى وَرَبِّى إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ </div><p>(And they ask you to inform them (saying): ""Is it true"" Say: ""Yes!

The second of these Ayat is this one:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَأْتِينَا السَّاعَةُ قُلْ بَلَى وَرَبِّى لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ</div><p>(Those who disbelieve say: ""The Hour will not come to us."" Say: ""Yes, by my Lord, it will come to you...""). And the third of them appears in Surat At-Taghabun, where Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُواْ قُلْ بَلَى وَرَبِّى لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ وَذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ </div><p>(The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for reckoning). Say: ""Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of what you did; and that is easy for Allah"") (64:7). And Allah says here:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُلْ بَلَى وَرَبِّى لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ</div><p>(Say: ""Yes, by my Lord, it will come to you..."")

Even though bones may be scattered and disintegrate, He knows where they have gone and where they have dispersed, then He will bring them back just as He created them in the first place, because He has knowledge of all things. Then Allah tells us of His wisdom in re-creating bodies and bringing about the Hour, as He says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِّيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ وَالَّذِينَ سَعَوْا فِى ءَايَـتِنَا مُعَاجِزِينَ</div><p>(That He may recompense those who believe and do righteous good deeds.

3613,"<h2>The Disbelievers' Denial of Life after Death, and the Refutation of Their View</h2><p>Here Allah tells us how the disbelievers and heretics denied that the Hour will come, and mocked the Messenger ﷺ for speaking of it.</p><p>وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَلْ نَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى رَجُلٍ يُنَبِّئُكُمْ إِذَا مُزِّقْتُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ</p><p>(Those who disbelieve say: ""Shall we direct you to a man who will tell you (that) when you have become fully disintegrated into dust with full dispersion..."") means, when your bodies have disintegrated into the earth and dispersed without a trace,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ</p><p>(then you) means, after this has happened,</p><p>لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ</p><p>(will be created (again) anew) means, you will be restored to life and will receive provision anew. `By telling us this, he is doing one of two things: either he is deliberately fabricating something and saying that Allah has revealed it to him, or he is not doing it deliberately, but he is deluded as crazy and insane people are.' They said:</p><p>أَفْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً أَم بِهِ جِنَّةٌ</p><p>(Has he invented a lie against Allah, or is there a madness in him) Allah said, refuting their words:</p><p>بَلِ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ فِى الْعَذَابِ وَالضَّلَـلِ الْبَعِيدِ</p><p>(Nay, but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are (themselves) in a torment, and in far error.) meaning, the matter is not as they claim or as they think; on the contrary, Muhammad ﷺ is the one who is telling the truth, and is righteous and wise; he is the one who has brought the truth, and they are the foolish and ignorant liars.</p><p>فِى الْعَذَابِ</p><p>are themselves( in a torment, means, their disbelief, which will lead them to the torment of Allah.</p><p>وَالضَّلَـلِ الْبَعِيدِ</p><p>(and in far error.) far from the truth in this world. Then Allah warns them of His power in the creation of heavens and earth, as He says:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَى مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(See they not what is before them and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth) meaning, wherever they go, in whatever direction, the heavens are above them and the earth is beneath them. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ - وَالاٌّرْضَ فَرَشْنَـهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَـهِدُونَ</p><p>(With Hands did We construct the heaven. Verily, We are Able to extend the vastness of space thereof. And We have spread out the earth; how Excellent Spreader (thereof) are We!) (51:47-48)</p><p>إِن نَّشَأْ نَخْسِفْ بِهِمُ الاٌّرْضَ أَوْ نُسْقِطْ عَلَيْهِمْ كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</p><p>(If We will, We shall sink the earth with them, or cause a piece of the heaven to fall upon them.) means, `if We wished, We could do that to them because of their wrongdoing and Our power over them, but We delay it because We are Patient and Forgiving.' Then Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاّيَةً لِّكُلِّ عَبْدٍ مُّنِيبٍ</p><p>(Verily, in this is a sign for every Munib servant.) Ma`mar narrating from Qatadah, said that Al-Munib means every one who repents. Sufyan narrated from Qatadah, that Al-Munib is the one who turns to Allah. This means that in looking at the creation of the heavens and the earth, there is a sign for every servant who is intelligent and wise and who turns towards Allah. There is a sign of the Allah's ability to recreate bodies and bring about the Resurrection, because the One Who was able to create these heavens -- with their vast reaches of space, and this earth, as deep and vast as it is -- is able to recreate bodies and revive decayed bones. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>أَوَلَـيْسَ الَذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم بَلَى</p><p>(Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth, Able to create the like of them Yes, indeed!) (36:81)</p><p>لَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not. ) (40:57)</p>"

3616,"<h2>The Favors which Allah bestowed upon Dawud</h2><p>Here Allah tells us how He blessed His servant and Messenger Dawud (David), peace be upon him, and what He gave him of His great bounty, giving him both prophethood and kingship, and huge numbers of troops. And He blessed him with a mighty voice. Such that when he glorified Allah, the firm, solid, high mountains joined him in glorifying Allah, and the free-roaming birds, who go out in the morning and come back in the evening, stopped for him, and he was able to speak all languages. In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ heard the voice of Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him, reciting at night, and he stopped and listened to his recitation, then he said:</p><p>«لَقَدْ أُوتِيَ هذَا مِزْمَارًا مِنْ مَزَامِيرِ آلِ دَاوُد»</p><p>(This man has been given one of the sweet melodious voices of the Prophet Dawud.) Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi said, ""I never heard any cymbal, stringed instrument or chord that was more beautiful than the voice of Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him.""</p><p>أَوِّبِى</p><p>(Glorify) means, glorify Allah. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others. The root of this word Ta'wib means to repeat or respond, so the mountains and birds were commanded to repeat after him.</p><p>وَأَلَنَّا لَهُ الْحَدِيدَ</p><p>And We made the iron soft for him. Al-Hلasan Al-Basلri, Qata0dah, Al-A mash and others said, He did not need to heat it in the fire or beat it with a hammer؛ he could simply twist it in his hands, like a thread. Allah said:</p><p>أَنِ اعْمَلْ سَـبِغَـتٍ</p><p>Saying: Make you perfect coats of mail... , which means chain mail. Qata0dah said, He was the first person ever to make chain mail؛ before that, they used to wear plated armor.</p><p>وَقَدِّرْ فِى السَّرْدِ</p><p>(and balance well the rings of chain armor Sard,) This is how Allah taught His Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, to make coats of mail. Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَدِّرْ فِى السَّرْدِ</p><p>(and balance well the rings of chain armor Sard,) ""Do not make the rivets too loose that the rings (of chain mail) will shake, or make them too tight that they will not be able to move at all, but make it just right."" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that `Ibn `Abbas said, ""Sard refers to a ring of iron."" Some of them said, ""Chain mail is called Masrud if it is held together with rivets.""</p><p>وَاعْمَلُواْ صَـلِحاً</p><p>and work you (men) righteousness. means, with regard to what Allah has given you of blessings.</p><p>إِنِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>Truly, I am All-Seer of what you do. means, watching you and seeing all that you do and say؛ nothing of that is hidden at all.</p>"

One of them said to his companion, `Ana Fatartuha,' meaning, `I started it.""' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, also said,</p><p>فَاطِرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Fatir of the heavens and the earth,) means, ""The Originator of the heavens and the earth."" Ad-Dahhak said, ""Every time the phrase Fatir As-Samawati wal-Ard is used in the Qur'an, it means the Creator of the heavens and the earth.""</p><p>جَاعِلِ الْمَلَـئِكَةِ رُسُلاً</p><p>(Who made the angels messengers) means, between Him and His Prophets.</p><p>أُوْلِى أَجْنِحَةٍ</p><p>with wings means, with which they fly to convey quickly that which they have been commanded to convey.</p><p>مَثْنَى وَثُلَـثَ وَرُبَاعَ</p><p>two or three or four. means, among them are some who have two wings, some have three and some who have four. Some have more than that, as stated in the Hadith mentioning that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril (peace be upon him) on the Night of the Isra’ with six hundred wings. Between each pair of wings was a distance like that between the east and the west. Allah says:</p><p>يَزِيدُ فِى الْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(He increases in creation what He wills. Verily, Allah is Able to do all things.) As-Suddi said, ""He increases their wings and creates them as He wills.""</p>"
3662,"<h2>None can withhold the Mercy of</h2><p>Allah Allah tells us that what He wills, happens, and what He does not will, does not happen. None can give what He withholds, and none can withhold what He gives. Imam Ahmad recorded that Warrad, the freed slave of Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah, said, ""Mu`awiyah wrote to Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah, saying, `Write for me what you heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.' So Al-Mughirah called me and I wrote for him: `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say when he finished praying,</p><p>«لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، اللْهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَد»</p><p>(There is no god (worthy of worship) except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. To Him be praise and dominion, and He is able to do all things. O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and and good fortune and richness in anything cannot benefit one against Your will.) `And I heard him forbid gossiping, asking too many questions and wasting money, burying girls alive, disobeying one's mother, and withholding from others while asking from them.""' This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, with several chain of narration. It was recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ raised his head from bowing, he would say:</p><p>«سَمِعَ اللهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ، اللْهُمَّ رَبَّنَا لَكَ الْحَمْدُ مِلْءُ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، وَمِلْءُ مَا شِئْتَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ بَعْدُ، اللْهُمَّ أَهْلَ الثَّنَاءِ وَالْمَجْدِ،أَحَقُّ مَا قَالَ الْعَبْدُ وَكُلُّنَا لَكَ عَبْدٌ، اللْهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَد»</p><p>(Allah hears those who praise Him. O Allah, our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens and the earth, and filling whatever You wish besides. O Allah, the One deserving praise and glory. The truest words that any servant says -- and all of us are Your servants -- are: O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone against Your will.)"" This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلاَ كَاشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَإِن يُرِدْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَلاَ رَآدَّ لِفَضْلِهِ</p><p>(And if Allah touches you with harm, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favor) (10:107). And there are many similar Ayat.</p>"
3663,"<h2>The Evidence of Tawhid</h2><p>Allah shows His servants that they should worship Him Alone, for just as He is Independent in His power of creation and provision, so He should be worshipped Alone with no partners or associates such as idols and false gods. So Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّى تُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(La ilaha illa Huwa. How then are you turning away (from Him)) meaning, `how can you turn away from Him after this has been made clear and this proof has been made obvious, but you still worship idols and false gods' And Allah knows best.</p>"
3664,"<h2>Consolation in the fact that the previous Messengers were denied, and a reminder of the Resurrection</h2><p>Allah says: `Even if these idolators who associate others with Allah disbelieve in you, O Muhammad, and go against the Message of Tawhid that you have brought, you have an example in the Messengers who came before you.' They also brought a clear Message to their people and told them to worship Allah alone, but their people denied them and went against them.</p><p>وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الأُمُورُ</p><p>(And to Allah return all matters (for decision).) means, `We will requite them for that in full.' Then Allah says:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ</p><p>(O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.) meaning the Resurrection will undoubtedy come to pass.</p><p>فَلاَ تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(So, let not this present life deceive you,) means, `this life is as nothing in compare to the great good that Allah has promised to His close friends and the followers of His Messengers, so do not let these transient attractions distract you from that which is lasting.'</p><p>وَلاَ يَغُرَّنَّكُم بِاللَّهِ الْغَرُورُ</p><p>(and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah.) This refers to Shaytan, as stated by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Meaning, do not let the Shaytan tempt you and divert you away from following the Messengers of Allah ﷺ and believing what they say, for he is the chief deceiver and arch-liar. This Ayah is like the Ayah that appears at the end of Surah Luqman:</p><p>فَلاَ تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا وَلاَ يَغُرَّنَّكُم بِاللَّهِ الْغَرُورُ</p><p>(let not then this (worldly) present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah) (31:33). Then Allah tells us of the enmity of Iblis towards the sons of Adam:</p><p>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَـنَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوّاً</p><p>(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy.) meaning, `he has declared his enmity towards you, so be even more hostile towards him, oppose him and do not believe the things with which he tries to tempt you.'</p><p>إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُواْ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.) means, `he only wants to misguide you so that you will enter the blazing Fire with him.' This is a manifest enemy, and we ask Allah, the All-Powerful and Almighty to make us enemies of Shaytan and to make us followers of the Book of Allah and of the way of His Messengers. For He is able to do whatever He wills and He will respond to all supplication. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَإِذَا قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لآِدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الْجِنِّ فَفَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِ أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِى وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ بِئْسَ لِلظَّـلِمِينَ بَدَلاً</p><p>(And (remember) when We said to the angels: ""Prostrate yourselves unto Adam."" So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.) (18:50)</p>"
3665,
3666,
3667,"<h2>The Punishment of the Disbeliever and the Reward of the Believer on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Having stated that the ultimate destiny of the followers of Iblis will be the blazing Fire, Allah then tells us that for those who disbelieve there will be a severe punishment. This is because they obeyed the Shaytan and disobeyed Ar-Rahman. And He tells us that those who believed in Allah and His Messengers</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ</div><p>(and do righteous good deeds, theirs will be forgiveness) meaning, from whatever sins they did,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</div><p>and a great reward. for the good deeds that they did.

Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ</div><p>(Truly, Allah is the All-Knower of what they do!)</p>"
3668,
3669,"<h2>Evidence of Life after Death</h2><p>Often Allah refers to the Resurrection by using the analogy of the earth coming back to life after it has died, as in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj, where He urges His servants to draw the lesson of the former from the latter. For the earth is dead and lifeless, with nothing growing in it, then He sends to it clouds which bring water, which He sends down upon it,</p><p>اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ</p><p>(it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth)) (22:5). So too, when Allah wishes to resurrect the bodies, He will send rain from beneath the Throne which will cover the whole earth, and the bodies will grow in their graves like seeds grow in the earth. It says in the Sahih:</p><p>«كُلُّ ابْنِ آدَمَ يَبْلَى إِلَّا عَجْبُ الذَّنَبِ، مِنْهُ خُلِقَ وَمِنْهُ يُرَكَّب»</p><p>(Every part of the son of Adam will disintegrate apart from the coccyx, from which he was created and from him he will be made anew.) Allah says:</p><p>كَذَلِكَ النُّشُورُ</p><p>As such (will be) the Resurrection! According to the Hadith of Abu Raz0n: I said, O Messenger of Allah, how will Allah bring the dead back to life؟ What is the sign of that in His creation؟ He said:</p><p>«يَا أَبَا رَزِينٍ أَمَا مَرَرْتَ بِوَادِي قَوْمِكَ مُمْحِلًا ثُمَّ مَرَرْتَ بِهِ يَهْتَزُّ خَضِرًا»</p><p>(O Abu Razin, do you not pass through the valley of your people (and see it) arid and barren, then you pass through it (and see it) stirred (to life) and green) I said, `Yes.' He said:</p><p>«فَكَذَلِكَ يُحْيِي اللهُ الْمَوْتَى»</p><p>(Thus will Allah bring the dead back to life.)""</p><h2>Honor, Power and Glory in this World and in the Hereafter come only by obeying Allah</h2><p>مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعِزَّةَ فَلِلَّهِ الْعِزَّةُ جَمِيعاً</p><p>(Whosoever desires Al-`Izzah then to Allah belongs all Al-`Izzah.) means, whoever desires honor, power and glory in this world and the next, let him be obedient towards Allah, may He be exalted. This will help him reach his goal, for Allah is the Sovereign of this world and the Hereafter, and to Him belong all honor, power and glory. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَتَّخِذُونَ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَيَبْتَغُونَ عِندَهُمُ الْعِزَّةَ فَإِنَّ العِزَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً</p><p>(Those who take disbelievers for protectors instead of believers, do they seek Al-`Izzah with them Verily, then to Allah belongs all honor, power and glory.) (4:139)</p><p>وَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ إِنَّ الْعِزَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً</p><p>(And let not their speech grieve you, for all Al-`Izzah belongs to Allah) (10:65).</p><p>وَلِلَّهِ الْعِزَّةُ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَـكِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But Al-`Izzah belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not) (63:8). Mujahid said:</p><p>مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعِزَّةَ</p><p>(Whosoever desires Al-`Izzah) means, by worshipping idols,</p><p>فَإِنَّ العِزَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً</p><p>(then to Allah belongs Al-`Izzah).</p><p>مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعِزَّةَفَإِنَّ العِزَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً</p><p>(Whosoever desires Al-`Izzah then to Allah belongs Al-`Izzah.) means, let him seek honor, power and glory through obeying Allah, may He be glorified.</p><h2>Righteous Deeds ascend to Allah</h2><p>إِلَيْهِ يَصْعَدُ الْكَلِمُ الطَّيِّبُ</p><p>(To Him ascend the good words,) means, words of remembrance, recitation of Qur'an, and supplications. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf. Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Mukhariq bin Sulaym said that ""`Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said to them, ""If we tell you a Hadith, we will bring you proof of it from the Book of Allah. When the Muslim servants says, `Glory and praise be to Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great and blessed be Allah,' an angel takes these words and puts them under his wing, then he ascends with them to the heaven. He does not take them past any group of angels but they seek forgiveness for the one who said them, until he brings them before Allah, may He be glorified."" Then `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, recited:</p><p>إِلَيْهِ يَصْعَدُ الْكَلِمُ الطَّيِّبُ وَالْعَمَلُ الصَّـلِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ</p><p>(To Him ascend the good words, and the righteous deeds exalt it)."" Imam Ahmad recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«الَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ اللهَ مِنْ جَلَالِ اللهِ مِنْ تَسْبِيحِهِ وَتَكْبِيرِهِ وَتَحْمِيدِهِ وَتَهْلِيلِهِ، يَتَعَاطَفْنَ حَوْلَ الْعَرْشِ لَهُنَّ دَوِيٌّ كَدَوِيِّ النَّحْلِ، يَذْكُرْنَ بِصَاحِبِهِنَّ، أَلَا يُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ لَا يَزَالَ لَهُ عِنْدَ اللهِ شَيْءٌ يُذَكِّرُ بِه»</p><p>(Those who remember Allah and glory Allah by saying, `Glory be to Allah, Allah is most Great, all praise is due to Allah and La ilaha illallah, these words go around the Throne buzzing like bees, mentioning those who said them. Would one of you not like to have something with Allah mentioning him)"" This was also recorded by Ibn Majah.</p><p>وَالْعَمَلُ الصَّـلِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ</p><p>and the righteous deeds exalt it. Ali bin Abi Tلalhلah reported that Ibn Abba0s, may Allah be pleased with him, said, The good word is the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, which is taken up to Allah, and the righteous deed is the performance of obligatory duties. Whoever remembers Allah when doing an obligatory duty, his deed carries his remembrance of Allah and takes it up to Allah, may He be exalted. Whoever remembers Allah and does not perform the obligatory duties, his words will be rejected, as will his deed.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يَمْكُرُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ</p><p>but those who plot evils, Muja0hid, Sa 0d bin Jubayr and Shahr bin Hلawshab said, This refers to those who show off by their actions, i.e., they deceive the people by giving the impression that they are obeying Allah, when in fact they are hated by Allah for showing off. Allah says:</p><p>لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَكْرُ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُوَ يَبُورُ</p><p>(theirs will be severe torment. And the plotting of such will perish.) meaning, it will fail and vanish, for their reality is apparent from up close to those who have insight and wisdom. No one conceals a secret but Allah will cause it to become known, on his face or by a slip of the tongue, or He will cause the person to wear it like a cloak (so that everyone will see it). If it is good, then the consequences will be good, and if it is bad, then the consequences will be bad. The person who shows off cannot continue to deceive anyone but the fool, but the believers who have insight are not deceived by that; from up close, they soon discover it. And nothing at all can be hidden from the Knower of the Unseen (Allah).</p><h2>Allah is the Creator and Knower of the Unseen</h2><p>وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ</p><p>(And Allah did create you from dust, then from Nutfah,) means, He initiated the creation of your father Adam from dust, then He created his offspring from semen of worthless water.</p><p>ثُمَّ جَعَلَكُمْ أَزْوَجاً</p><p>then He made you pairs. means, male and female, as a kindness and a mercy from Him, He gave you partners from your own kind, that you may find repose in them.</p><p>وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَى وَلاَ تَضَعُ إِلاَّ بِعِلْمِهِ</p><p>(And no female conceives or gives birth but with His knowledge.) means, He knows about that and nothing is hidden from Him at all, but,</p><p>وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.) (6:59) We have already discussed in this respect in the Ayah:</p><p>اللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَى وَمَا تَغِيضُ الاٌّرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ - عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ</p><p>(Allah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Great, the Most High.) (13:8-9).</p><p>وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ</p><p>(And no aged man is granted a length of life nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book.) means, some of those sperm are granted a long life, which He knows and it is recorded with Him in the First Book.</p><p>وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ</p><p>nor is a part cut off from his life, Here the pronoun (his) refers to mankind in general, not to a specific person, because the long life which is recorded in the Book and is known by Allah will not be cut off. It was reported via Al- Awfi that Ibn Abba0s said concerning the A0yah,</p><p>وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</p><p>(And no aged man is granted a length of life nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.) There is no one for whom Allah has decreed a long life but he will reach the age that has been decreed for him. When he reaches the time that has been decreed for him, he will not surpass it. And there is no one for whom Allah has decreed a short life but it will end when he reaches the age that has been decreed for him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</p><p>(nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.) He said, ""That is recorded in a Book with Him."" This was also the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim. On the other hand, some of them said, ""The phrase</p><p>وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ</p><p>(And no aged man is granted a length of life) means, what He decrees for him of life, and</p><p>وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ</p><p>nor is a part cut off from his life means, his time is constantly decreasing. All of this is known to Allah year after year, month after month, week after week, day after day, hour after hour. Everything is written with Allah in His Book. This was reported by Ibn Jar0r from Abu Ma0lik, and was also the view of As-Suddi and Atلa0 Al-Khura0sa0ni. In the Tafsir of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p>«مَنْ سَرَّهُ أَنْ يُبْسَطَ لَهُ فِي رِزْقِهِ وَيُنْسَأَ لَهُ فِي أَثَرِهِ فَلْيَصِلْ رَحِمَه»</p><p>(Whoever would like to have ample provision and a long life, let him uphold the ties of kinship.)"" It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and Abu Dawud.</p><p>إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</p><p>Surely, that is easy for Allah. means, that is very easy for Him, and He has detailed knowledge of all His creation, for His knowledge encompasses all things, and nothing at all is hidden from Him.</p>"

Its chain of narration is good (Jayyid) . Ibn Hibban recorded in his Sahih that Jundub bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَنْ قَرَأَ يس فِي لَيْلَةٍ ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ غُفِرَ لَه»</p><p>(Whoever recites Ya Sin in the night, seeking the Face of Allah, will be forgiven.)</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Messenger was sent as a Warner</h2><p>We have already discussed the individual letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.</p><p>وَالْقُرْءَانِ الْحَكِيمِ</p><p>(By the Qur'an, full of wisdom) means, Al-Muhkam (perfect) which falsehood cannot come to from before it or behind it.</p><p>إِنَّكَ</p><p>(Truly, you) means, O Muhammad,</p><p>لَمِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَعَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(are one of the Messengers, on the straight path.) means, following a straight methodology and religion, and an upright Law.</p><p>تَنزِيلَ الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(Sent down by the Almighty, the Most Merciful.) means, this path which you have brought is a revelation from the Lord of might Who is Most Merciful to His believing servants. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ - صِرَطِ اللَّهِ الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَلاَ إِلَى اللَّهِ تَصِيرُ الاٍّمُورُ</p><p>(And verily, you are indeed guiding (mankind) to the straight path. The path of Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. Verily, to Allah all matters return.) (42:52-53).</p><p>لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ</p><p>(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) This refers to the Arabs, for no warner had come to them before him. The fact that they alone are mentioned does not mean that others are excluded, just as mentioning some individuals does not mean that all others are excluded. We have already mentioned the Ayat and Mutawatir Hadiths which state that the mission of the Prophet is universal, when we discussed the meaning of the Ayah:</p><p>قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</p><p>(Say: ""O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah."")

3713,"<h2>The State of Those Who are decreed to be among the Doomed</h2><p>Allah says: `In the case of those who are decreed to be among the doomed, when it comes to the matter of being guided, We have made them like a person who has a chain around his neck and whose hands are tied together beneath his chin so that his head is lifted up.' As Allah says:</p><p>فَهُم مُّقْمَحُونَ</p><p>(so that their heads are raised up.) Mentioning the chains around the neck is sufficient and there is no need to mention the hands, although they are referred to by implication. Al-`Awfi said, narrating from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, concerning the Ayah:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا فِى أَعْنـقِهِمْ أَغْلَـلاً فَهِىَ إِلَى الاٌّذْقَـنِ فَهُم مُّقْمَحُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We have put on their necks iron collars reaching to the chins, so that their heads are raised up.) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ</p><p>(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck)(17:29). meaning that their hands are tied to their necks and they cannot stretch them forth in order to do any good deeds.</p><p>فَهُم مُّقْمَحُونَ</p><p>(so that their heads are raised up.) according to Mujahid it means their heads are raised, and their hands are placed over their mouths, so they are restrained from doing anything good.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا مِن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ سَدّاً</p><p>(And We have put a barrier before them,) Mujahid said, ""Between them and the truth.""</p><p>ومِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ سَدّاً</p><p>(and a barrier behind them,) Mujahid said, ""Between them and the truth, so they are confused."" Qatadah said, ""They move from one form of misguidance to another.""</p><p>فَأغْشَيْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(and We have covered them up,) means, `We have blinded their eyes to the truth.'</p><p>فَهُمْ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(so that they cannot see.) means, they cannot benefit from goodness or be guided to it. Ibn Jarir said, ""It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that he used to recite ""Fa a`shaynahum"" instead of Fa'aghshaynahum, from Al-`Asha (weakness of the sight, blindness), which is a complaint of the eye."" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, ""Allah placed this barrier between them and Islam and Iman, so that they will never reach it,"" and he recited:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe, Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) (10:96-97). Then he said, ""Whoever has been prevented by Allah, will never be able."" `Ikrimah said, ""Abu Jahl said, `If I see Muhammad, I will do such and such.' Then Allah revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا فِى أَعْنـقِهِمْ أَغْلَـلاً</p><p>(Verily, We have put on their necks iron collars...) up to:</p><p>فَهُمْ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(so that they cannot see.)"" He said, ""They used to say, `Here is Muhammad,' and he would say, `Where is he Where is he' And he would not be able to see him."" Ibn Jarir also recorded this.</p><p>وَسَوَآءُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَءَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤمِنُونَ</p><p>(It is the same to them whether you warn them or you warn them not, they will not believe.) means, Allah has decreed that they will be misguided, so warning them will not help them and will not have any effect on them. Something similar has already been seen at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and Allah also says:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe, Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.)(10:96-97).</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الذِّكْرَ</p><p>(You can only warn him who follows the Reminder,) means, `only the believers will benefit from your warning, those who follow the Reminder,' which is the Qur'an.</p><p>وَخشِىَ الرَّحْمـنَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(and fears the Most Gracious unseen.) means, even when no one sees him except Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, he knows that Allah is watching him and sees what he does.</p><p>فَبَشِّرْهُ بِمَغْفِرَةٍ</p><p>(Bear you to such one the glad tidings of forgiveness,) i.e., of his sins,</p><p>وَأَجْرٍ كَرِيمٍ</p><p>(and a generous reward.) means, one that is vast and great and beautiful. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.) (67:12).</p><p>إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead,) means, on the Day of Resurrection. This also indicates that Allah gives life to the heart of whomever He wills among the disbelievers, those whose hearts have died in misguidance, by guiding them after that to the truth. As Allah says after mentioning hardness of the heart:</p><p>اعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُحْىِ الاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ الاٌّيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death! Indeed We have made clear the Ayat to you, that you may understand.) (57:17)</p><p>وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ</p><p>(and We record that which they send before (them),) means, their deeds.</p><p>وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(and their traces) means, `We write down the deeds which they used to do themselves, and the legacy they left behind, so We will requite them for that: if it is good, then We will reward them, and if it is evil, then We will punish them.' This is like the Hadith:</p><p>«مَنْ سَنَّ فِي الْإِسْلَامِ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً كَانَ لَهُ أَجْرُهَا، وَأَجْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا، وَمَنْ سَنَّ فِي الْإِسْلَامِ سُنَّةً سَيِّـــئَـةً كَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرُهَا وَوِزْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أَوْزَارِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Whoever starts (or sets an example of) something good in Islam, will have a reward for it, and a reward equal to that of everyone who does it after him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. Whoever starts (or sets an example of) something evil in Islam, will bear the burden for that, and a burden equal to that of everyone who does it after him, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.) This was recorded by Muslim from Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali, may Allah be pleased with him in which is detailed a story of the people from the Mudar tribe, who were wearing woollen rags. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith in full from Jarir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him. In it the Prophet then recited:</p><p>وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(and We record that which they send before (them), and their traces) Muslim also recorded it with a different chain of narration. There is also another Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: مِنْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ مِنْ بَعْدِه»</p><p>(When the son of Adam dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: knowledge which is beneficial to others, a righteous child who prays for him, or ongoing charity which he leaves behind. )"" Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Abu Sa`id said, ""I heard Mujahid say concerning the Ayah:</p><p>إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them), and their traces) `What they left behind of misguidance.""' Ibn Abi Najih and others said, narrating from Mujahid:</p><p>مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ</p><p>(that which they send before (them),) ""Their deeds.""</p><p>وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(and their traces). He said, ""Their footsteps."" This was also the view of Al-Hasan and Qatadah.</p><p>وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(and their traces) means their footsteps. Qatadah said, ""If Allah were to have neglected anything with regard to you, O son of Adam, He would have neglected what the wind could remove of these footsteps."" But He takes into account the footsteps of the son of Adam and all his deeds; He even takes into account these footsteps and whether they are for the purpose of obeying Allah or disobeying Him. So, whoever can have his footsteps recorded for the purpose of obeying Allah, let him do that. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""There was an empty area around the Masjid, and Banu Salamah wanted to move to be closer to the Masjid. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ heard about that, he said to them:</p><p>«إِنَّهُ بَلَغَنِي أَنَّكُمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَنْتَقِلُوا قُرْبَ الْمَسْجِدِ؟»</p><p>(I have heard that you want to move close to the Masjid.) They said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah, that is what we want.' He said:</p><p>«يَا بَنِي سَلِمَةَ دِيَارَكُمْ تُكْتَبْ آثَارُكُمْ، دِيَارَكُمْ تُكْتَبْ آثَارُكُم»</p><p>(O Banu Salamah, stay where you are, and your footsteps will be recorded, stay where you are, and your footsteps will be recorded.)"" This was also recorded by Muslim from Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""A man died in Al-Madinah and the Prophet prayed over him, and said,</p><p>«يَا لَيْتَهُ مَاتَ فِي غَيْرِ مَوْلِدِه»</p><p>(Would that he had died somewhere other than in his place of birth!) A man among the people said, `Why, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ إِذَا تُوُفِّيَ فِي غَيْرِ مَوْلِدِهِ، قِيسَ لَهُ مِنْ مَوْلِدِهِ إِلَى مُنْقَطِعِ أَثَرِهِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(When a man dies somewhere other than in his place of birth, it will be measured for him from where he was born to where his footsteps no longer appear, (and this is the space that will be allocated for him) in Paradise.)"" It was also recorded by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. Ibn Jarir narrated that Thabit said, ""I was walking with Anas and I began to walk quickly. He took my hand and we walked slowly, and when we had finished praying, Anas said, `I walked with Zayd bin Thabit and I was walking quickly, and he said: O Anas! Do you not feel that your footsteps are being written down""' There is no contradiction between this and the first report, on the contrary, this indicates the same thing somewhat more forcefully. Because these footsteps are being recorded, then those which are setting an example, whether good or bad, are more likely to be recorded. And Allah knows best.</p><p>وَكُلَّ شىْءٍ أَحْصَيْنَـهُ فِى إِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(and all things We have recorded with numbers (as a record) in Imam Mubin (a Clear Book).) means, everything that exists is precisely dictated in a record in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz. Al-Imam Al-Mubin here refers to the source of all records. This was the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Similarly, Allah also says:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَدْعُواْ كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَـمِهِمْ</p><p>((And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam (record of good and bad deeds)) (17:71). meaning the Book of their deeds which will testify as to their deeds, whether they were good or bad. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ</p><p>(and the Book will be placed (open), and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward) (39:69), and</p><p>وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ فَتَرَى الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ وَيَقُولُونَ يوَيْلَتَنَا مَا لِهَـذَا الْكِتَـبِ لاَ يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلاَ كَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ أَحْصَاهَا وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا</p><p>(And the Book (one's Record) will be placed, and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is (recorded) therein.

And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49).</p>"

The stars and planets in the sky give light to the people of earth, as Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin, and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.) (67:5),</p><p>وَلَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا فِى السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَزَيَّنَّـهَا لِلنَّـظِرِينَ - وَحَفِظْنَـهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ رَّجِيمٍ - إِلاَّ مَنِ اسْتَرَقَ السَّمْعَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it from every outcast Shaytan. Except him who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18). And Allah says here:</p><p>وَحِفْظاً</p><p>(And to guard) meaning, to protect as it should be protected,</p><p>مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ</p><p>(against every rebellious Shaytan. ) means, every insolent and impudent devil, when he wants to eavesdrop (on news in the heavens), a piercing fire comes and burns him. Allah, may He be glorified, says:</p><p>لاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(They cannot listen to the higher group) meaning, they cannot reach the higher group -- which refers to the heavens and the angels in them -- when they speak of what has been revealed by Allah of His Laws and decrees. We have already mentioned this when explaining the Hadiths quoted when we discussed the Ayah,</p><p>حَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ</p><p>(when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: ""What is it that your Lord has said"" They say: ""The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.) (34:23). Allah says:</p><p>وَيَقْذِفُونَ</p><p>(for they are pelted) meaning, they are hit,</p><p>مِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ</p><p>(from every side.) means, from all directions from which they try to reach the heaven.</p><p>دُحُوراً</p><p>(Outcast,) means, they are rejected, and are repelled and prevented from reaching it, and they are pelted.</p><p>وَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ</p><p>(and theirs is a constant torment.) means, in the Hereafter, they will have an ongoing, everlasting and painful torment, as Allah says:</p><p>وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire) (67:5).</p><p>إِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ</p><p>(Except such as snatch away something by stealing,) means, except for the one among the Shayatin who manages to get something, which is a word he has heard from the heaven. Then he throws it down to the one who is beneath him, who in turn throws it down to the one who is beneath him. Perhaps the flaming fire will strike him before he is able to throw it down, or perhaps he will throw it -- by the decree of Allah -- before the flaming fire strikes him and burns him. So the other devil takes it to the soothsayer, as we have seen previously in the Hadith. Allah says:</p><p>إِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ</p><p>(Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) meaning, shining brightly. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""The Shayatin had places where they sat in the heavens listening to what was being revealed by Allah. The stars did not move and the Shayatin were not struck. When they heard the revelation, they would come down to earth and to every word they would add nine of their own. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent, if a Shaytan wanted to take his seat in the heavens, the flaming fire would come and would not miss him; it would burn him every time. They complained about this to Iblis, may Allah curse him, and he said, `Something must have happened.' He sent his troops out and they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ standing in prayer between the two mountains of Nakhlah."" -- Waki` said, ""This means in the valley of Nakhlah."" -- ""They went back to Iblis and told him about that, and he said, `This is what has happened.""'</p>"

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and others said, ""The ways to the heaven."" Ad-Dahhak, said, ""Then let them ascend into the seventh heaven.""

And he used to recite Bani Isra'il Al-Isra' and Az-Zumar every night.""</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Order for Tawhid and the Refutation of Shirk</h2><p>Allah tells us that the revelation of this Book, which is the magnificent Qur'an, is from Him, and is truth in which there is no doubt whatsoever. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ - عَلَى قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ - بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And truly, this is a revelation from the Lord of the creatures, which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down upon your heart that you may be (one) of the warners, in the plain Arabic language.) (26:192-195)</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِالذِّكْرِ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُ لَكِتَـبٌ عَزِيزٌ - لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ</p><p>(And verily, it is a mighty Book. Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.) (40: 41,42) And Allah says here:</p><p>تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ</p><p>(The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Almighty,) meaning, the Almighty, All-Powerful.</p><p>الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(the All-Wise.) meaning, in all that He says, does, legislates and decrees.</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ الدِّينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have sent down the Book to you in truth. So, worship Allah by doing religious deeds sincerely for Him only.) means, so worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and call mankind to that, and teach them that it is not right to worship anyone or anything except Him Alone, and He has no partner, equal or rival. Allah says:</p><p>أَلاَ لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ</p><p>(Surely, the religion is for Allah only.) meaning, He will not accept any deed unless it is done purely and sincerely for Him Alone, with no partner or associate. Then Allah tells us that the idolators say:</p><p>مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَى</p><p>(We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah.) meaning what motivates them to worship them is the fact that they made their idols in the image of the angels -- or so they claim -- and when they worship those images it is like worshipping the angels, so that they will intercede with Allah for them to help and give them provision and other worldly needs. As far as the resurrection is concerned, they denied it and did not believe in it. Qatadah, As-Suddi and Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam and Ibn Zayd:</p><p>إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَى</p><p>(only that they may bring us near to Allah. ) means, ""So that they may intercede for us and bring us closer to Him."" During Jahiliyyah, they used to recite the following for their Talbiyah when they performed Hajj; ""At Your service, You have no partner except the partner You have; he and all that he owns belong to You."" This pretentious argument which the idolators of all times, ancient and modern, used as evidence is what the Messengers, may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all, came to refute and forbid, and to call people to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. This is something that the idolators themselves invented; Allah did not give them permission for it, nor does He approve of it; indeed, He hates it and forbids it.</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): ""Worship Allah, and avoid Taghut."") (16:36)</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): ""None has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me."") (21:25) And Allah tells us that the angels in the heavens, those who are close to Him and others, are all servants who submit humbly to Allah. They do not intercede with Him except by His leave for the one with whom He is pleased. They are not like the princes and ministers of their (the idolators') kings who intercede with them without their permission for both those whom the kings like and those whom they hate.</p><p>فَلاَ تَضْرِبُواْ لِلَّهِ الاٌّمْثَالَ</p><p>(So put not forward similitudes for Allah) (16:74). Exalted be Allah far above that.</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, Allah will judge between them) means, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>فِى مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</p><p>(concerning that wherein they differ.) means, He will judge between His creation on the Day of Resurrection and will reward or punish each person according to his deeds.</p><p>وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ يَقُولُ لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ أَهَـؤُلاَءِ إِيَّاكُمْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ - قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَكَ أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا مِن دُونِهِمْ بَلْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ الْجِنَّ أَكْـثَرُهُم بِهِم مُّؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And (remember) the Day when He will gather them all together, then He will say to the angels: ""Was it you that these people used to worship"" They (the angels) will say: ""Glorified be You! You are our Wali (Lord) instead of them. Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn; most of them were believers in them."") (34:40-41)</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى مَنْ هُوَ كَـذِبٌ كَـفَّارٌ</p><p>(Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.) means, He will not show true guidance to one who deliberately tells lies about Allah and whose heart rejects the signs and proof of Allah. Then Allah states that He does not have any offspring, as the ignorant idolators claim the angels to be, and as the stubborn Jews and Christians claim `Uzayr and `Isa to be. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son (or offspring), He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created.) meaning, the matter would not have been as they claim. This is a conditional sentence which does not imply that this happened or that it is permitted; indeed, it is impossible. The aim is only to point out the ignorance of their claims. It is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ</p><p>(Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that).) (21:17)</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(Say: ""If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of worshippers."") (43:81) All of these Ayat are conditional, and it is permissible to form a conditional sentence referring to something that is impossible if it serves the purposes of the speaker.</p><p>سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) means, exalted and sanctified be He above the idea that He could have any offspring, for He is the One, the Only, the Unique, the Self-Sufficient Master to Whom everything is enslaved and is in need of. He is the One Who is independent of all else, Who has subjugated all things and they submit humbly to Him. Blessed and exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers and deniers say.</p>"

All of this was recorded by the the Imam, great scholar, Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam, may Allah have mercy upon him, in his book Fada'il Al-Qur'an. Humayd bin Zanjuyah narrated that `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""The parable of the Qur'an is that of a man who sets out to find a place for his family to stay, and he comes to a place where there is evidence of rainfall. While he is walking about, admiring it, he suddenly comes upon beautiful gardens. He says, `I liked the first traces of rainfall, but this is far better.' It was said to him, `The first place is like the Qur'an, and these beautiful gardens are like the splendor of family of Ha Mim in relation to the rest of the Qur'an'.""

4140,"<h2>The Bearers of the Throne praise Allah and pray for forgiveness for the Believers</h2><p>Allah tells us that the angels who are close to Him, the bearers of the Throne, and the angels who are around Him -- all glorify the praises of their Lord. They combine glorification (Tasbih) which implies that He is free of any shortcomings, with praise (Tahmid) which is an affirmation of praise.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ</div><p>(and believe in Him,) means, they humbly submit themselves before Him.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</div><p>(and ask forgiveness for those who believe) means, for those among the people of earth who believe in the Unseen. Allah commanded that His angels who are close to Him should pray for the believers in their absence, so it is a part of the angels' nature that they say Amin when a believer prays for his brother in his absence. In Sahih Muslim it says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«إِذَا دَعَا الْمُسْلِمُ لِأَخِيهِ بِظَهْرِ الْغَيْبِ قَالَ الْمَلَكُ: آمِينَ وَلَكَ بِمِثْلِه»</div><p>(When a Muslim prays for his brother in his absence, the angel says, `Amin, and may you have something similar to it'.)""

On the contrary We will raise the one whose deeds are of a lower status so that they will become equal, as a favor and a blessing from Us.' Sa`id bin Jubayr said that when the believer enters Paradise, he will ask where his father, son and brother are. It will be said to him, `they did not reach the same level of good deeds as you did'. He will say, `but I did it for my sake and for theirs.' Then they will be brought to join him in that higher degree.

4143,"<h2>The Regret of the Disbelievers after They enter Hell</h2><p>Allah tells us that the disbelievers will feel regret on the Day of Resurrection, when they enter Hell and sink in the agonizing depth of fire. When they actually experience the unbearable punishment of Allah, they will hate themselves with the utmost hatred, because of the sins they committed in the past, which were the cause of their entering the Fire. At that point the angels will tell them in a loud voice that Allah's hatred towards them in this world, when Faith was offered to them and they rejected it, is greater than their hatred towards themselves in this situation. Qatadah said, concerning the Ayah:</p><p>لَمَقْتُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ مِن مَّقْتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُـمْ إِذْ تُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى الإِيمَـنِ فَتَكْفُرُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, Allah's aversion was greater towards you than your aversion toward yourselves, when you were called to the Faith but you used to refuse.) ""Allah's hatred for the people of misguidance -- when Faith is presented to them in this world, and they turn away from it and refuse to accept it -- is greater than their hatred for themselves when they see the punishment of Allah with their own eyes on the Day of Resurrection."" This was also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Dharr bin `Ubaydullah Al-Hamdani, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari, may Allah have mercy on them all.</p><p>قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ</p><p>(They will say: ""Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice!..."") Ath-Thawri narrated from Abu Ishaq from Abu Al-Ahwas from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him: ""This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life and then unto Him you will return.)""(2:28) This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and Abu Malik. This is undoubtedly the correct view. What is meant by all of this is that when they are standing before Allah in the arena of Resurrection, the disbelievers will ask to go back, as Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ</p><p>(And if you only could see when the criminals shall hang their heads before their Lord (saying): ""Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back, that we will do righteous good deeds. Verily, we now believe with certainty."") (32:12), However, they will get no response. Then when they see the Fire and they are held over it and they look at the punishments therein, they will ask even more fervently than before to go back, but they will get no response. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ - بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: ""Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!"" Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.) (6:27-28). When they actually enter Hell and have a taste of its heat, hooked rods of iron and chains, their plea to go back will be at its most desperate and fervent:</p><p>وَهُمْ يَصْطَرِخُونَ فِيهَا رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً غَيْرَ الَّذِى كُـنَّا نَعْمَلُ أَوَلَمْ نُعَمِّرْكُمْ مَّا يَتَذَكَّرُ فِيهِ مَن تَذَكَّرَ وَجَآءَكُمُ النَّذِيرُ فَذُوقُواْ فَمَا لِلظَّـلِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ</p><p>(Therein they will cry: ""Our Lord! Bring us out, we shall do righteous good deeds, not that we used do."" (Allah will reply): ""Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it And the warner came to you. So taste you. For the wrongdoers there is no helper."") (35:37)</p><p>رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ - قَالَ اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ</p><p>(Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers."" He (Allah) will say: ""Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) (23:108). According to this Ayah, they will speak more eloquently, and they will introduce their plea with the words:</p><p>رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ</p><p>(Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice!) meaning, `by Your almighty power, You have brought us to life after we were dead, then You caused us to die after we were alive; You are able to do whatever You will. We confess our sins and admit that we wronged ourselves in the world,'</p><p>فَهَلْ إِلَى خُرُوجٍ مِّن سَبِيلٍ</p><p>(then is there any way to get out) means, `will You answer our prayer to send us back to the world, for You are able to do that, so that we might do deeds different from those which we used to do Then if we go back to our former ways, we will indeed be wrongdoers.' The response will be: `There is no way for you to go back to the world.' Then the reason for that will be given: `Your nature will not accept the truth and be governed by it, you would reject it and ignore it.' Allah says:</p><p>ذَلِكُم بِأَنَّهُ إِذَا دُعِىَ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ كَـفَرْتُمْ وَإِن يُشْرَكْ بِهِ تُؤْمِنُواْ</p><p>((It will be said): ""This is because, when Allah Alone was invoked (in worship), you disbelieved; but when partners were joined to Him, you believed!"") meaning, `if you were to go back, this is how you would be.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ</p><p>(But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that when they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars) (6:28).</p><p>فَالْحُكْمُ للَّهِ الْعَلِـىِّ الْكَبِيرِ</p><p>(So the judgement is only with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great!) means, He is the Judge of His creation, the Just Who is never unjust. He guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills; He has mercy on whomsoever He wills and punishes whomsoever He wills; there is no God except Him.</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى يُرِيكُمْ ءَايَـتِهِ</p><p>(It is He Who shows you His Ayat) means, He demonstrates His power to His servants through the mighty signs which they see in His creation, above and below, which indicate the perfection of its Creator and Originator.</p><p>وَيُنَزِّلُ لَكُم مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ رِزْقاً</p><p>(and sends down provision for you from the sky.) this refers to rain, through which crops and fruits are brought forth, which with their different colors, tastes, fragrances and forms are a sign of the Creator. It is one kind of water, but by His great power He makes all these things different.</p><p>وَمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ</p><p>(And none remembers) means, no one learns a lesson or is reminded by these things, or takes them as a sign of the might of the Creator,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن يُنِيبُ</p><p>(but those who turn in repentance.) which means, those who have insight and turn to Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.</p><h2>The Believers are commanded to worship Allah Alone no matter what Their Circumstances</h2><p>فَادْعُواْ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(So, call you upon Allah making religion sincerely for Him, however much the disbelievers may hate.) This means, worship Allah and call upon Him alone in all sincerity. Do not be like the idolators in conduct and beliefs. Imam Ahmad recorded that after ending every prayer, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr used to say: ""There is no (true) God except Allah Alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and praise, for He is able to do all things; there is no strength and no power except with Allah; there is no (true) God except Allah and we worship none but Him; to Him belongs the blessings and the virtue and good praise; there is no (true) God except Allah, we worship Him in all sincerity even though the disbelievers may hate that."" He said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say Tahlil with this after every prayer."" Something similar was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. It was reported in Sahih from Ibn Az-Zubayr, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say the following after the prescribed (obligatory) prayers:</p><p>«لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ، لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا نَعْبُدُ إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ، لَهُ النِّعْمَةُ وَلَهُ الْفَضْلُ وَلَهُ الثَّــنَاءُ الْحَسَنُ، لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُون»</p><p>(There is no (true) God except Allah Alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and praise, for He is able to do all things; there is no strength and no power except with Allah; there is no (true) God except Allah and we worship none but Him; His is the blessing and virtue and good praise; there is no (true) God except Allah, we worship Him in all sincerity even though the disbelievers hate that.)</p>"

This was also the view of `Ikrimah. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا </div><p>(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself.

The Zakah paid on one's wealth is so called because it purifies wealth, and it is a means of increasing it, blessing it and making it more beneficial, and a means of assisting one to use it in doing good deeds. Qatadah said, ""They withheld the Zakah of their wealth."" This is the apparent meaning according to many of the scholars of Tafsir, and this is the view favored by Ibn Jarir. But the matter is subject to further examination, because the obligation of Zakah was instituted during the second year after the Hijrah to Al-Madinah, according to what is stated by several scholars. Yet this Ayah was revealed in Makkah. However, it is not unlikely that the principle of giving charity and Zakah was already in place and had been enjoined at the beginning of the Prophet's mission, as Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest) (6:141). As for the details of Zakah and how it is to be calculated according to the Nusub, were explained in Al-Madinah. This is how we may reconcile between the two opinions. Similarly, prayer was originally enjoined before sunrise and before sunset at the beginning of the Prophet's mission; it was only on the Night of the Isra', a year and a half before the Hijrah, that Allah enjoined upon His Messenger the five daily prayers. The conditions and essential elements of prayer were explained later, in stages. And Allah knows best. Then Allah says:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ </div><p>(Truly, those who believe and do righteous good deeds, for them will be an endless reward that will never stop.) Mujahid and others said, ""It will never be cut off or decrease."" This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدًا </div><p>(They shall abide therein for ever.)

Allah says that He created the earth first, because it is the foundation, and the foundation should be built first, then the roof. Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">هُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَاتٍ</div><p>(He it is Who created for you all that is on the earth.

(79:27-33) This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: ""A man said to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: `I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ</div><p>(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101),</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ </div><p>(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27),</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً</div><p>(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42),</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</div><p>(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) But in this Ayah they did hide something.

This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah; At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih. ""</p><p>وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ الْجَمْعِ</p><p>(and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling) i.e., the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will assemble the first and the last in one plain.</p><p>لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p>(of which there is no doubt,) means, there is no doubt that it will happen and will most certainly come to pass.</p><p>فَرِيقٌ فِى الْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِى السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(a party will be in Paradise and a party in the blazing Fire.) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ الْجَمْعِ ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ التَّغَابُنِ</p><p>((And remember) the Day when He will gather you (all) on the Day of Gathering, --- that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain) (64:9). which means that the people of Paradise and the people of Hell will gain and lose, respectively. And it is like the Ayah:</p><p>إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَةً لِّمَنْ خَافَ عَذَابَ الاٌّخِرَةِ ذلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّجْمُوعٌ لَّهُ النَّاسُ وَذَلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّشْهُودٌ - وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلاَّ لاًّجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ - يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لاَ تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِىٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ</p><p>(Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens and the earth) will be present. And We delay it only for a term fixed. On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.) (11:103-105) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; came out to us, holding two books in his hand. He said,</p><p>«أَتَدْرُونَ مَا هذَانِ الْكِتَابَانِ؟»</p><p>(Do you know what these two books are) We said, ""We do not know unless you tell us, O Messenger of Allah."" Concerning the book in his right hand, He said:</p><p>«هَذَا كِتَابٌ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ بِأَسْمَاءِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَأَسْمَاءِ آبَائِهِمْ وَقَبَائِلِهِمْ، ثُمَّ أُجْمِلَ عَلى آخِرِهِمْ، لَا يُزَادُ فِيهِمْ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ مِنْهُمْ أبدًا»</p><p>(This is a book from the Lord of the worlds, containing the names of the people of Paradise and of their fathers and tribes; all of them are detailed, down to the last one of them, and nothing will be added or taken away from it.) Then concerning the book in his left hand, he said:</p><p>«هَذَا كِتَابُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ وَأَسْمَاءِ آبَائِهِمْ وَقَبَائِلِهِمْ، ثُمَّ أُجْمِلَ عَلى آخِرِهِمْ، لَا يُزَادُ فِيهِمْ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ مِنْهُمْ أَبَدًا»</p><p>(This is the book of the people of Hell, containing their names and the names of their fathers and tribes, all of them are detailed down to the last one of them, and nothing will be added or taken away from it.) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said, ""Why should we strive if it is something that is already cut and dried"" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«سَدِّدُوا وَقَارِبُوا فَإِنَّ صَاحِبَ الْجَنَّةِ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنْ عَمِلَ أَيَّ عَمَلٍ،وَإِنَّ صَاحِبَ النَّارِ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَإِنْ عَمِلَ أَيَّ عَمَل»</p><p>(Strive with your deeds as hard as you can for middle course or close to it, for the person who is destined for Paradise will die doing the deeds of the people of Paradise, regardless of what he did before, and the person who is destined for Hell will die doing the deeds of the people of Hell, regardless of what he did before.) Then he made a gesture with his fist and said,</p><p>«فَرَغَ رَبُّكُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مِنَ الْعِبَاد»</p><p>(Your Lord has settled the matter of His servants) and he opened his right hand as if throwing something;</p><p>«فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(A party in Paradise.) and he made a similar gesture with his left hand;</p><p>«فَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِير»</p><p>(And a party in the blazing Fire.)"" This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i; At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih Gharib."" Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Nadrah said, ""One of the Companions of the Prophet , whose name was Abu Abdullah, was visited by some of his friends, and they found him weeping. They asked him, `What has caused you to weep Didn't the Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; say to you,</p><p>«خُذْ مِنْ شَارِبِكَ ثُمَّ أَقِرَّهُ حَتَّى تَلْقَانِي»</p><p>(Trim your moustache and adhere to that practice until you meet me)' He said, `Yes, but I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say;</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى قَبَضَ بِيَمِينِهِ قَبْضَةً وَأُخْرَى بِالْيَدِ الْأُخْرَى، قَالَ: هذِهِ لِهذِهِ، وَهذِهِ لِهذِهِ، وَلَا أُبَالِي»</p><p>(Allah picked up a handful in His Right Hand and another in His other Hand, and said, ""This is for this and this is for this, and I do not care."") `And I do not know in which of the two handfuls I am.""' There are several Hadiths about Al-Qadr (the Divine Decree) in the books of Sahih, Sunan and Musnad. Including those narrated by `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, `A'ishah and a large number of Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p><p>وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لَجَعَلَهُمْ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And if Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation,) means, either all following guidance or all following misguidance, but He made them all different, and He guides whomsoever He wills to the truth and He sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He has complete wisdom and perfect proof. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَـكِن يُدْخِلُ مَن يَشَآءُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِ وَالظَّـلِمُونَ مَا لَهُمْ مِّن وَلِىٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ</p><p>(but He admits whom He wills to His mercy.

4423,"<h2>Alarming the Idolators with News of the Day when the Sky will bring forth a visible Smoke</h2><p>Allah says, these idolaters are playing about in doubt, i.e., the certain truth has come to them, but they doubt it and do not believe in it. Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, ""We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.""' He said, ""We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ</p><p>(Say: ""No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders."") (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.""' According to another report: ""A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.""</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ - يَغْشَى النَّاسَ هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, ""O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, ""Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)"" He said, ""This means the day of Badr."" Ibn Mas`ud said, ""Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment."" This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتْى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخُرُوجَ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجَ عِيْسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَثَلَاثَةَ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارًا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنَ تَسُوقُ النَّاسَ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا، وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)"" This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Ibn Sayyad:</p><p>«إِنِّي خَبَأْتُ لَكَ خَبْأ»</p><p>(I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was concealing from him the words,</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)""This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, ""It is Ad-Dukh,"" meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah</p><p>يَغْشَى النَّاسَ</p><p>(Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said ""covering mankind.""</p><p>هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.</p><p>رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مْؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>((They will say): ""Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!"") means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: ""Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!"") (6:27)</p><p>وَأَنذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ</p><p>(And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say: ""Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!"" (It will be said): ""Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).) (14:44) Allah says here:</p><p>أَنَّى لَهُمُ الذِّكْرَى وَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ - ثُمَّ تَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ مُعَلَّمٌ مَّجْنُونٌ</p><p>(How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them. Then they had turned away from him and said: ""(He is) one taught, a madman!"") meaning, `what further admonition do they need when We have sent them a Messenger with a clear Message and warning Yet despite that, they turned away from him, opposed him and rejected him, and they said: (He is) one taught (by a human being), a madman.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him) (89:23)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُواْ فَلاَ فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُواْ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ - وَقَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place. And they will say (in the Hereafter): ""We do believe (now);"" but how could they receive (faith and its acceptance by Allah) from a place so far off...) (34:51-52)</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) means, `if We were to remove the torment from you for a while, and send you back to the world, you would go back to your former state of disbelief and denial.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَـهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.) (23:75)</p><p>وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ</p><p>(But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars) (6:28)</p><h2>The Meaning of the ""Great Batshah""</h2><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.) Ibn Mas`ud interpreted this to mean the day of Badr. This is also the view of a group who agreed with Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, about the meaning of the smoke, as discussed above. It was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, in a report related to him from Al-`Awfi and from Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him. This is possible, but the apparent meaning is that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, although the day of Badr was also a day of vengeance. Ibn Jarir said, ""Ya`qub narrated to me; Ibn `Ulayyah narrated to me, Khalid Al-Hadhdha' narrated to us, from `Ikrimah who said, `Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said that ""the great Batshah"" is the day of Badr, and I say that it is the Day of Resurrection."" This chain of narration is Sahih to him. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri and of `Ikrimah according to the more authentic of the two reports narrated from him. And Allah knows best.</p>"

(Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken only idols besides Allah!

4517,"<h2>Refuting Claims of the Idolators about the Qur'an and the Messenger</h2><p>Concerning the disbelief and rebellion of the idolators, Allah says that when the clear Ayat of Allah are recited to them they say;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">هَـذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(This is plain magic!) meaning, simple magic. In this statement of theirs, they have lied, invented a falsehood, went astray and disbelieved.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ</div><p>(Or they say: ""He has fabricated it."" ) They are referring to Muhammad .

No one on the earth -- you or anyone else -- would then be able to protect me from Him.' It is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُلْ إِنِّى لَن يُجِيرَنِى مِنَ اللَّهِ أَحَدٌ وَلَنْ أَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً إِلاَّ بَلاَغاً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِسَـلَـتِهِ</div><p>(Say: ""None can protect me from Allah, nor would I find a refuge except in Him. (My duty) is only to convey from Allah and (deliver) His Messages. "") (72:22-23) Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ الاٌّقَاوِيلِ - لأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُ بِالْيَمِينِ - ثُمَّ لَقَطَعْنَا مِنْهُ الْوَتِينَ - فَمَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَـجِزِينَ </div><p>(And if he made up a false saying concerning Us, We surely would have seized him by the right hand. Then we would have cut off his life artery. And none of you could withhold Us from (punishing) him.) (69:44-47) Thus, Allah says here,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُلْ إِنِ افْتَرَيْتُهُ فَلاَ تَمْلِكُونَ لِى مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ كَفَى بِهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ</div><p>(Say: ""If I have fabricated it, still you have no power to support me against Allah. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it (i.e. this Qur'an)! Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you!..."") This is a severe threat, intimidation and warning for them. Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.) This is an encouragement for them to repent and turn to Allah. It means, `despite all of this, if you turn back and repent, Allah will accept your repentance, pardon you, forgive you, and have mercy upon on.' This is similar to Allah's saying in Surat Al-Furqan,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً - قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً </div><p>(And they say: ""(This Book is) legends of the ancients that he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon."" Say: ""It has been sent down by the One Who knows every secret within the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful."") (25:5-6) Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعاً مِّنَ الرُّسُلِ</div><p>(Say: ""I am not a new thing among the Messengers..."") which means, `I am not the first Messenger who ever came to the world. Rather, Messengers came before me. Therefore, I am not an unprecedented incident that should cause you all to reject me and doubt my being sent to you. Indeed, Allah has sent before me all of the Prophets to various nations.' Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَدْرِى مَا يُفْعَلُ بِى وَلاَ بِكُمْ</div><p>(nor do I know what will be done with me or with you.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""It (this Ayah) was followed in revelation by,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ</div><p>(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). Similarly, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said that this Ayah was abrogated by the Ayah;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ</div><p>(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). They said that when the latter Ayah was revealed, one of the Muslims said to Allah's Messenger , ""Allah has declared what He will do for you. But what will He do for us"" Then Allah revealed;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِّيُدْخِلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</div><p>(That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow). This is what they said. That which has been confirmed in the Sahih is that the believers said, ""May you enjoy that, O Allah's Messenger! But what do we get"" So Allah revealed this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit, reported that Umm Al-`Ala' -- a woman from the Ansar who had given her pledge of loyalty to Allah's Messenger -- said, ""When the Ansar drew lots regarding taking in the Muhajirun to dwell with them, our lot was to have `Uthman bin Maz`un. Later, `Uthman fell sick in our house, so we nursed him until he died, and we wrapped him in his garments (for burial). Allah's Messenger then came in, and I said, `O Abu As-Sa'ib! May Allah have mercy on you. I bear witness that Allah has indeed honored you.' Allah's Messenger asked,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«وَمَا يُدْرِيكِ أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى أَكْرَمَه»</div><p>(How do you know that Allah has honored him) I said, `I do not know -- may my father and mother both be ransoms for you!' Allah's Messenger then said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ،وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْرَ. وَاللهِ مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِي»</div><p>(As for him, certainty (death) has reached him from his Lord, and I surely wish well for him. But by Allah, even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to me (after death).) I then said, `Never will I claim a person to be pious after this.' This incident caused me some distress, and I went to sleep thereafter. I saw in my dream that `Uthman owned a running water spring. I went to Allah's Messenger and told him about that. Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«ذَاكِ عَمَلُه»</div><p>(That was his (good) deeds.)"" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith but Muslim did not. In one of the narrations, Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِه»</div><p>(Even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to him.) This and similar texts indicate that it is not allowed to declare that a specific person will enter Jannah except for those who were distinctly indicated by Allah or his Messenger . Examples of those are the Ten, Ibn Sallam, Al-Ghumaysa', Bilal, Suraqah, `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Haram (Jabir's father), the Seventy Recitors (of Qur'an) who were assassinated near the Well of Ma`unah, Zayd bin Harithah, Ja`far, Ibn Rawahah, and other similar individuals, may Allah be pleased with them. Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلاَّ مَا يُوحَى إِلَىَّ</div><p>(I only follow that which is revealed to me, ) which means, `I only follow what Allah has revealed to me of the revelation.'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَنَاْ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(and I am but a plain warner.) meaning, `my warnings are obvious to every person with sound intellect and reason.'

The witness here refers to any witness in general. It includes `Abdullah bin Salam and other from them as well. For indeed, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before `Abdullah bin Salam had accepted Islam. This is similar to the statement of Allah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَآ إنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>(And when it is recited to them, they say: ""We believe in it.

Concerning him the following Ayah was revealed,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ</div><p>((at the same time), a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar)"" This has been recorded in the Two Sahihs and An-Nasa'i. Similarly, Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Yusuf bin `Abdullah bin Salam, Hilal bin Yasaf, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas and Ibn Zayd all said that this refers to `Abdullah bin Salam.

By that, they meant Bilal, `Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab, may Allah be pleased with them, and others like them of the weak, the male servants, and female servants. The pagans said this only because they thought that they held a high status with Allah, and that He took special care of them.

Contrary to this is the position of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah: They say about any act or saying that has not been reported from the Companions: ""It is an innovation. If there was any good in it, they would have preceded us in doing it, because they have not left off any of the good characteristics except that they hurried to perform them."" Allah continues,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُواْ بِهِ</div><p>(And when they have not been guided by it,) meaning, the Qur'an.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَسَيَقُولُونَ هَـذَآ إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ</div><p>(they say: ""This is an ancient falsehood!"") meaning, an old lie.

This is clear arrogance, as Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس»</div><p>((Arrogance is) rejecting the truth and belittling the people.)

Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ</div><p>(For it is the truth from their Lord.) which is a beautifully placed parenthetical clause.

Later on, after the war ends and the conflict has ceased, you have a choice in regard to the captives: You may either act graciously toward them by setting them free without charge, or free them for a ransom that you require from them.' It appears that this Ayah was revealed after the battle of Badr. At that time, Allah reproached the believers for sparing many of the enemy's soldiers, and holding too many captives in order to take ransom from them. So He said then:</p><p>مَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ أَسْرَى حَتَّى يُثْخِنَ فِي الاٌّرْضِ تُرِيدُونَ عَرَضَ الدُّنْيَا وَاللَّهُ يُرِيدُ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ - لَّوْلاَ كِتَـبٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ سَبَقَ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِيمَآ أَخَذْتُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(It is not for a Prophet to have captives of war until he had made a great slaughter (among the enemies) in the land. You desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. Allah is Mighty and Wise.

(8:67-68) Allah's saying,</p><p>حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا</p><p>(...until the war lays down its burden.) Mujahid said: ""Until `Isa bin Maryam (peace be upon him) descends.""

Imam Ahmad recorded from Jubayr bin Nufayr who reported from Salamah bin Nufayl that he went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, ""I have let my horse go, and thrown down my weapon, for the war has ended. There is no more fighting."" Then the Prophet said to him,</p><p>«الْانَ جَاءَ الْقِتَالُ، لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى النَّاسِ، يُزِيغُ اللهُ تَعَالَى قُلُوبَ أَقْوَام، فَيُقَاتِلُونَهُمْ وَيَرْزُقُهُمُ اللهُ مِنْهُمْ حَتْى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ عَلَى ذلِكَ، أَلَا إِنَّ عُقْرَ دَارِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الشَّامُ، وَالْخَيْلُ مَعْقُودٌ فِي نَوَاصِيهَا الْخَيْرُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Now the time of fighting has come.

Allah will turn the hearts of some people away (from the truth), so they (that group) will fight against them, and Allah will bestow on them (war spoils) from them (the enemies) -- until Allah's command comes to pass while they are in that state. Verily, the center of the believers' abode is Ash-Sham. And goodness is tied around the horses' foreheads till the Day of Resurrection.) An-Nasa'i also recorded this narration. Allah then says,</p><p>ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لاَنْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(Thus, and had Allah so willed, He could have taken vengeance against them;) which means that had He so willed, He could have taken immediate vengeance against the disbelievers with a chastisement or exemplary punishment directly from Him.</p><p>وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ</p><p>(but (He lets you struggle) so as to test with one another.) meaning, He has ordered Jihad and fighting against the enemies in order to try you and test your affairs. Allah also expresses His wisdom by the legislation of Jihad in the following two Surahs, Al `Iman and At-Tawbah, in which He says,</p><p>أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ جَـهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ الصَّـبِرِينَ</p><p>(Or did you think that you would enter the Paradise before Allah had made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast) (3:142)</p><p>قَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(Fight them; Allah will then punish them by your hands, disgrace them, grant you victory over them, satisfy the breasts of a believing people, and remove the fury of their (the believers') hearts. Allah turns in forgiveness to whom He wills; Allah is Knowing and Wise.) ( 9:14-15)</p><h2>Merit of the Martyrs</h2><p>Since it is customary during wars that many of the believers die, Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ</p><p>(But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.) which means that He would not let their good deeds go to waste, but would rather multiply and increase them. Some of them will continue being rewarded for their good deeds for the entire length of their stay in Al-Barzakh. This has been mentioned in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad on the authority of Kathir bin Murrah, who reported from Qays Al-Judhami, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الشَّهِيدُ سِتَّ خِصَالٍ عِنْدَ أَوَّلِ قَطْرَةٍ مِنْ دَمِهِ: تُكَفَّرُ عَنْهُ كُلُّ خَطِيئَةٍ، وَيَرَى مَقْعَدَهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَيُزَوَّجُ مِنَ الْحُورِ الْعِين، وَيَأْمَنُ مِنَ الْفَزَعِ الْأَكْبَرِ، وَمِنْ عَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ، وَيُحَلَّى حُلَّةَ الْإِيمَان»</p><p>(As the first drop of his blood gushes forth, a martyr is granted six merits: all of his sins are forgiven, he is shown his place in Paradise, he is married to wide-eyed Huris, he is secured from the great fear (on Judgement Day) and the torment of the grave, and he is adorned with the adornments of Iman.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, reported that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُشَفَّعُ الشَّهِيدُ فِي سَبْعِينَ مِنْ أَهْلِ بَيْتِه»</p><p>(A martyr is allowed to intercede for seventy members of his household. ) This was recorded by Abu Dawud, and there are numerous other Hadiths mentioning the merits of the martyrs. As for Allah's saying,</p><p>سَيَهْدِيهِمْ</p><p>(He will guide them) meaning, He will guide them to Jannah. This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ يَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِإِيمَانِهِمْ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الاٌّنْهَـرُ فِي جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ</p><p>(Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous good deeds, their Lord will guide them because of their Faith: beneath them rivers will flow in the Gardens of Pleasure.) (10:9) Allah says,</p><p>وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ</p><p>(and amend their condition.) meaning, their situation and affairs.</p><p>وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ</p><p>(And (He will) admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.) It means that He has acquainted them with Paradise and guided them to it. Mujahid said: ""The people of Paradise will be guided to their houses and dwellings and whatever sections Allah has ordained for them in it. They will not make mistakes in this, nor will they ask anyone for directions to their dwellings -- as if they had dwelt in it from the time they were first created."" Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا خَلَصَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ مِنَ النَّارِ حُبِسُوا بِقَنْطَرَةٍ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ، يَتَقَاصُّونَ مَظَالِمَ كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا، حَتْى إذَا هُذِّبُوا وَنُقُّوا أُذِنَ لَهُمْ فِي دُخُولِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ إِنَّ أَحَدَهُمْ بِمَنْزِلِهِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَهْدَى مِنْهُ بِمَنْزِلِهِ الَّذِي كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(After the believers securely pass the Fire (on the Day of Judgement), they will be held back upon a bridge between Paradise and the Fire. There, they will have any acts of injustice that they committed against one another in the life of this world rectified. After they are completely purified and cleansed (from injustice), they will be admitted into Paradise. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, each one of them will find his way to his dwelling in Paradise better than he found his way to his dwelling in the worldly life.)</p><h2>Support Allah's Cause, He will then support You</h2><p>Allah then says:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ</p><p>(O you who believe! If you support (the cause of) Allah, He will support you and make your foothold firm.) This is similar to His saying,</p><p>وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ</p><p>(Indeed, Allah will surely support those who support Him (His cause).) (22:40) That is because the reward is comparable to the type of deed that is performed. Thus, Allah says here,</p><p>وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ</p><p>(and make your foothold firm.) Allah then says,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَتَعْساً لَّهُمْ</p><p>(But as for those who disbelieve -- misery awaits them) This misery is the opposite of making firm the footholds of the believers who support the cause of Allah and His Messenger . It has been confirmed in a Hadith that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«تَعِسَ عَبْدُالدِّينَارِ، تَعِسَ عَبْدُالدِّرْهَمِ، تَعِسَ عَبْدُالْقَطِيفَةِ، تَعِسَ وَانْتَكَسَ وَإِذَا شِيكَ فَلَا انْتَقَش»</p><p>(Misery awaits the servant of the Dinar; misery awaits the servant of the Dirham; misery awaits the servant of velvet. Misery awaits him, and degeneracy; and if he is pricked by a thorn, may he not find anyone to pull it for him.) This means may Allah not cure him. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ</p><p>(and (Allah) will make their deeds vain.) meaning, He will nullify them and make them fruitless. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَرِهُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ</p><p>(That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down;) which means that they did not want or like what Allah revealed.</p><p>فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ</p><p>(so He made their deeds fruitless.)</p>"

4555,"<h2>Admonition and Fire for the Disbelievers; Paradise for Those Who have Taqwa</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ</p><p>(Have they not traveled) meaning, those who associate partners with Allah and deny His Messenger .</p><p>فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(through the land and seen what happened in the end to those before them Allah destroyed them completely,) which means that Allah punished them because of their denial and disbelief, and saved the believers from among them. That is why He says,</p><p>وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا</p><p>(and a similar (end awaits) the disbelievers.) Then Allah says,</p><p>ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ مَوْلَى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَأَنَّ الْكَـفِرِينَ لاَ مَوْلَى لَهُمْ</p><p>(That is because Allah is the Protector of all those who believe, whereas the disbelievers have no protector.) After the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb, the commander of the idolators at that time, inquired about the Prophet , Abu Bakr, and `Umar, may Allah be pleased with them. When he heard no response, he announced: ""Verily, those three have died!"" `Umar then responded to him: ""You lie, O enemy of Allah! Allah has indeed saved those who will displease you. Indeed, those whom you mentioned are all alive!"" Abu Sufyan then said: ""Well, today makes up for (the defeat on) the day of Badr, and the war has its ups and downs. And indeed, you are going to find mutilation (in the bodies of your dead) that I did not command, nor did I prohibit."" Then he turned around chanting: ""Glory to Hubal (their greatest idol), Glory to Hubal."" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَلَا تُجِيبُوهُ؟»</p><p>(Aren't you going to respond to him) The Companions said: ""What should we say, O Messenger of Allah"" He said:</p><p>« قُولُوا: اللهُ أَعْلَى وَأَجَل»</p><p>(Say: ""Allah is Most High and Most Glorious."") Then Abu Sufyan said: ""We have Al-`Uzza (their second idol), and you have no `Uzza. (honor)."" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَلَا تُجِيبُوهُ؟»</p><p>(Aren't you all going to respond to him) They said: ""What should we say, O Messenger of Allah"" He said:</p><p>«قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»</p><p>(Say: ""Allah is our Protector, and you have no protector."") Allah then says,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ جَنَـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous good deeds into Gardens through which rivers flow.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ الاٌّنْعَـمُ</p><p>(Whereas those who disbelieve enjoy their life and eat as cattle eat. ) Which means that the disbelievers enjoy their worldly life and eat in it like animals, munching and gnawing (with greed). They have no concern other than that. Thus, it has been confirmed in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ يَأْكُلُ فِي مِعىً وَاحِدٍ، وَالْكَافِرُ يَأْكُلُ فِي سَبْعَةِ أَمْعَاء»</p><p>(A believer eats with one intestine, and a disbeliever eats with seven intestines.) Then Allah says,</p><p>وَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ</p><p>(but the Fire will be their abode.) meaning, on the Day of their Reckoning. Allah then says,</p><p>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِىَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ</p><p>(And how many a town mightier than your town that has driven you out) meaning, Makkah.</p><p>أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ فَلاَ نَـصِرَ لَهُمْ</p><p>(We have destroyed, with none to help them!) gThis is a great threat and severe warning to the people of Makkah because they rejected Allah's Messenger ﷺ, who was the chief of the Messengers and the last of the Prophets. If Allah had destroyed the previous nations because of their denial of their Messengers, what then would those (people of Makkah) expect that Allah would do to them in the worldly life and the Hereafter And if the torment were to be lifted off some of them in this life by the blessing of the presence of the Messenger, the Prophet of Mercy, the torment will be stored for them in their next life, as Allah says,</p><p>يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ مَا كَانُواْ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ السَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُواْ يُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(Their torment will be doubled! They could not bear to hear (the preaching), and they used not to see (the truth).) (11:20) Concerning Allah's saying,</p><p>مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ</p><p>(than Your town that has driven you out) This means, `its people who have driven you (Muhammad ﷺ ) out from amongst them (the people of Makkah).' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that when Allah's Messenger ﷺ left Makkah (at the time of Hijrah -- migration), and he reached the cave and hid inside it, he looked back toward Makkah and said,</p><p>«أَنْتِ أَحَبُّ بِلَادِ اللهِ إِلَى اللهِ، وَأَنْتِ أَحَبُّ بِلَادِ اللهِ إِلَيَّ، وَلَوْلَا أَنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَخْرَجُونِي لَمْ أَخْرُجْ مِنْك»</p><p>(You are the most beloved to Allah among Allah's lands, and you are also the most beloved to me among Allah's lands. Were it not that the idolators have driven me out from you, I would never have left you.) Ibn `Abbas then said, ""The worst of enemies is he who transgresses against Allah in His own sacred place, who kills a person who is not trying to kill him, or who kills because of Jahiliyyah vengeance. Allah then revealed to His Prophet ,</p><p>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِىَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ فَلاَ نَـصِرَ لَهُمْ</p><p>(And how many a town mightier than your town that has driven you out have We destroyed, with none to help them!)""</p>"
4584,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><h2>The Merit of Surah Al-Fath</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin Mughaffal, who said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited Surah Al-Fath on the (day) of the conquest of Makkah, riding on his she-camel. He recited it in a vibrating and pleasant tone. Mu`awiyah (a subnarrator) added: ""Were I not afraid that the people would crowd around me, I would surely try to imitate and produce his recitation."" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith through Shu`bah.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Reason behind revealing Surat Al-Fath</h2><p>This honorable Surah was revealed after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ returned from the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah, during the month of Dhul-Qa`dah, in the sixth year of Hijrah. This is when the idolators prevented him from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram to perform the `Umrah he intended. They stopped the Prophet from reaching Makkah at that time, but then were prone to peace negotiations. A peace treaty was conducted stipulating that the Messenger would return this year and then come back for `Umrah the following year. The Messenger ﷺ  agreed. However, some of the Companions disliked these terms, including `Umar bin Al-Khattab, as we will mention in detail, Allah willing, while explaining this Surah. After the Prophet slaughtered his sacrificial animals in the area where he was stopped and headed back to Al-Madinah, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Surah about what occurred between him and the idolators. Allah declared the Al-Hudaybiyyah peace treaty a manifest victory, because of the benefits peace would carry and the good results that did originate from it. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and other Companions said, ""You consider the conquering of Makkah to be Al-Fath (the victory), while to us, Al-Fath is the treaty conducted at Al-Hلudaybiyyah."" Jabir (bin `Abdullah) said, ""We only considered Al-Fath to be the day of Hلudaybiyyah!"" Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' (bin `Azib) said, ""You consider Al-Fath to be the conquest of Makkah, which was indeed a victory. However, we consider Al-Fath to be the pledge of Ar-Ridwan on the Day of Al-Hudaybiyyah. Then, we were fourteen hundred with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Al-Hudaybiyyah had a well, whose water we consumed, not leaving a drop of water in it. When the news of what happened reached the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he came towards us and sat on the edge of the well. Then he asked to be brought a bucket of water and used it for ablution. He next rinsed his mouth, invoked Allah and poured that water into the well. Soon after, that well provided us, as well as our animals, with sufficient water, in whatever amount of water we wished. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on a trip, and I asked him about a matter three times, but he did not answer me. So I said to myself, `May your mother lose you, O son of Al-Khattab! You were stubborn in repeating your question three times to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; each time he did not respond to you.' So I mounted my animal, my camel, and went ahead for fear that a part of the Qur'an might be revealed in my case. Suddenly, I heard a caller calling, `O `Umar!' So, I went to the Messenger while fearing that part of the Qur'an was revealed about me. The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَزَلَ عَلَيَّ الْبَارِحَةَ سُورَةٌ هِيَ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا:</p><p>إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحاً مُّبِيناً لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ»</p><p>(Last night, a Surah was revealed to me that is dearer to me than this life and all that it contains: (Verily, We have given you a manifest victory. That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future.)) Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith from several chains of narration through Malik, may Allah grant him His mercy. `Ali bin Al-Madini commented, ""This is a good chain of narration consisting of the scholars of Al-Madinah."" Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""This Ayah was revealed to the Prophet ,</p><p>لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ</p><p>(That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future,) on his return from Al-Hudaybiyyah. The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَقَدْ أُنْزِلَتْ عَلَيَّ اللَّيْلَةَ آيَةٌ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا عَلَى الْأَرْض»</p><p>(Tonight, an Ayah, that is dearer to me than all that the earth carries, was revealed to me.) The Prophet recited the Ayah to them. They said, `Congratulations, O Allah's Messenger! Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has stated what He will do with you. So what will He do with us' These Ayat were revealed to the Prophet ,</p><p>لِّيُدْخِلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</p><p>(That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow. ..), until,</p><p>فَوْزاً عَظِيماً</p><p>(...a supreme success.)"" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said, ""The Prophet used to pray until both his feet were swollen. He was asked, `Has not Allah forgiven you all your sins of the past and of future' He said,</p><p>«أَفَلَا أَكُونُ عَبْدًا شَكُورًا؟»</p><p>(Should I not be a thankful servant)"" The two collectors of the Sahihs collected this Hadith, as well as, the rest of the Group, except Abu Dawud. Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحاً مُّبِيناً</p><p>(Verily, We have given you a manifest victory.) means, clear and apparent victory. This Ayah is about the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah, which resulted in great goodness, including people embracing Islam in large crowds and having the chance to meet each other openly. During that time, the believers preached to the idolators and thus beneficial knowledge and faith spread all around. Allah's statement,</p><p>لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ</p><p>(That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, ) contains one of the special virtues of the Messenger ﷺ, and no one else shares this honor with him. There is not an authentic Hadith that states that any person other than the Messenger ﷺ earned forgiveness for all of his sins of the past and future on account of performing good deeds. This, indeed, is a great honor for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , who fulfilled the requirements of Allah's obedience, righteousness and straightness at a level never surpassed by a human being in past generations, nor will it ever be surpassed in the generations to come. Muhammad ﷺ is the perfect human being and the leader and chief of all mankind in this life and the Hereafter. And since he was, and will always be, the most obedient of Allah's creation to Him and the most honoring of Allah's commands and prohibitions, he said when his she- camel insisted on kneeling down,</p><p>«حَبَسَها حَابِسُ الْفِيل»</p><p>(He Who stopped the elephant, has stopped her too.) The Prophet then declared,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْأَلُونِّي الْيَوْمَ شَيْئًا يُعَظِّمُونَ بِهِ حُرُمَاتِ اللهِ إِلَّا أَجَبْتُهُمْ إِلَيْهَا»</p><p>(By the Name of Him in Whose Hand my soul is, this day, if they ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.) And when the Messenger obeyed Allah and accepted the peace offer from the Quraysh, Allah the Exalted said to him,</p><p>إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحاً مُّبِيناً لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ وَيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ</p><p>(Verily, We have given you a manifest victory. That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His favor on you,) in this life and the Hereafter,</p><p>وَيَهْدِيَكَ صِرَطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً</p><p>(and guide you on the straight path,) with the glorious legislation and the straight religion that He ordains on you,</p><p>وَيَنصُرَكَ اللَّهُ نَصْراً عَزِيزاً</p><p>(And that Allah may help you with strong help.) due to your obedience of the orders of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored; Allah will elevate your status and give you victory above your enemies. An authentic Hadith states,</p><p>«وَمَا زَادَ اللهُ عَبْدًا بِعَفْوٍ إِلَّا عِزًّا. وَمَا تَوَاضَعَ أَحَدٌ للهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَّا رَفَعَهُ اللهُ تَعَالَى»</p><p>(No servant pardons but Allah grants him honor, and none humbles himself for Allah except that Allah the exalted and sublime raises him (in rank).) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""You will never punish someone who disobeyed Allah with you better than obeying Allah the Exalted and Most Honored with him.""</p>"

Qatadah commented, ""Grace into the hearts of the believers"", that is, the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, on the Day of Al-Hudaybiyyah. The companions were they, who accepted the call of Allah and His Messenger and obeyed the decisions of Allah and His Messenger . When their hearts felt content with acceptance and were at peace, Allah increased their faith, joining it to the faith they already had. Al-Bukhari, and other Imams, relied on this Ayah as proof that faith increases and decreases in the hearts. Allah the Exalted said next that had He willed, He would have inflicted defeat on the disbelievers, Allah says;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And to Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth) and had He willed to send only one angel to them, that angel would have brought destruction to all what they had. However, Allah the Exalted willed Jihad and fighting to be established for, and by, the believers for great wisdom, clear reasons and unequivocal evidences that He had in all this.

We explained these meanings in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Ahzab. Allah said,</p><p>لِّتُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُعَزِّرُوهُ</p><p>(In order that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you Tu`azziruh) or you honor him, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas and several others,</p><p>وَتُوَقِّرُوهُ</p><p>(and Tuwaqqiruh), where Tawqir means, respect, honor and high regard,</p><p>وَتُسَبِّحُوهُ</p><p>(and that you Tusabbihuh), glorify Allah's praises,</p><p>بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً</p><p>(Bukrah and Asila), the early and late part of the day.</p><h2>The Pledge of Ar-Ridwan</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Most Honored honors, regards and praises His Messenger by saying,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُبَايِعُونَكَ إِنَّمَا يُبَايِعُونَ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Verily, those who give pledge to you, they are giving pledge to Allah.) Allah the Exalted and Most High said in another Ayah,</p><p>مَّنْ يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ</p><p>(He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allah.) (4:80) Allah said, next,</p><p>يَدُ اللَّهِ فَوْقَ أَيْدِيهِمْ</p><p>(The Hand of Allah is over their hands.) meaning, He is with them, hearing their statements and witnessing their stand, having full knowledge of them inwardly and outwardly. Therefore, Allah the Exalted was indeed taking the pledge from them through His Messenger ,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَلَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الّجَنَّةَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنجِيلِ وَالْقُرْءانِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ مِنَ اللَّهِ فَاسْتَبْشِرُواْ بِبَيْعِكُمُ الَّذِى بَايَعْتُمْ بِهِ وَذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for which theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's cause, so they kill and are killed. It is a promise in truth, binding on Him in the Tawrah and the Injil and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah Then rejoice in the bargain you have concluded. That is the supreme success.)(9:111) Allah said,</p><p>وَمَنْ أَوْفَى بِمَا عَـهَدَ عَلَيْهِ اللَّهَ فَسَيُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(...and whosoever fulfills what the covenants he makes with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward.) a generous reward. The pledge mentioned here is the pledge of Ar-Ridwan which was pledged under a tree, a Samurah, in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah. The number of the Companions who gave their pledge to Allah's Messenger ﷺ at that time was either 1,300, 1,400 or 1,500. However, 1,400 is the better choice.</p><h2>Hadiths about the Pledge at Al-Hudaybiyyah</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""We numbered one thousand and four hundred on the day of Hudaybiyyah."" Muslim also collected this Hadith. The Two Sahihs recorded that Jabir said; ""We numbered one thousand and four hundred at that time. The Messenger placed his hand in the water and it started gushing forth from between his fingers until everyone had quenched their thirst."" This is a short form of the story. Another narration of it mentioned that the Companions became thirsty on the day of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave them an arrow from his quiver. They took the arrow, placed it in the well of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the water gushed out until they all satisfied their thirst. Jabir was asked how many of them there were on that day and he said, ""We were one thousand and four hundred. And had we been a hundred thousand, that water would still have been sufficient to satisfy us all."" In another narration collected in the Two Sahihs, Jabir bin `Abdullah said that they were one thousand and five hundred at the time. Al-Bukhari recorded that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib was asked by Qatadah, ""How many were present for the pledge of Ar-Ridwan"" Sa`id said, ""One thousand and five hundred."" Qatadah posed, ""Jabir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them both, said that they were one thousand and four hundred."" Sa`id said, ""He forgot. He told me that they were one thousand and five hundred."" However, Al-Bayhaqi commented, ""This narration testifies that Jabir used to state that they were one thousand and five hundred, but later on remembered the true number and said that they were one thousand and four hundred.""</p><h2>The Reason behind conducting the Pledge of Ar-Ridwan</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said in his book on Sirah: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ beckoned `Umar bin Al-Khattab in order to send him to Makkah, so that he could inform the chiefs of Quraysh of the Prophet's intent (to perform `Umrah at Makkah). `Umar said, `O Allah's Messenger! I fear the Quraysh for my being. There are no longer any chiefs from the tribe of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b remaining in Makkah who would protect me, in addition, the Quraysh know my enmity and harshness against them. However, I could tell you about a man who is mightier than I in Makkah: `Uthman bin `Affan. We should send him to Abu Sufyan and the chiefs of the Quraysh informing them that you did not come to fight them, but to visit this House and to honor its holiness.' `Uthman left to Makkah. He met Aban bin Sa`id bin Al-`As upon entering Makkah or just before that. As a result, Aban took `Uthman with him and extended his protection to him so he could deliver the message of Allah's Messenger ﷺ. `Uthman indeed went to Abu Sufyan and the chiefs of Quraysh and imparted the Prophet's message that he was sent with. When `Uthman finished delivering the Prophet's message to them they said to him, `If you wish, you can perform Tawaf around the House.' `Uthman replied, `I would not do that before the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gets the chance to perform Tawaf around it.' So the Quraysh kept `Uthman waiting in Makkah. However, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Muslims were told that `Uthman had been killed."" Ibn Ishaq continued, ""I was told by `Abdullah bin Abu Bakr that when news of `Uthman's death was conveyed to him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نَبْرَحُ حَتْى نُنَاجِزَ الْقَوْم»</p><p>(We will not leave until we fight the people.)"" Ibn Ishaq continued, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ called the Muslims to give a pledge of allegiance, resulting in the pledge of Ar-Ridwan being conducted under the tree. Later, people used to say that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took the pledge from them to die. However, Jabir bin `Abdullah said, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not ask us to give a pledge to die (or be victorious), but that we would not run away (from battle).' The Muslims gave their pledge and none among them held back from giving it, except Al-Jadd bin Qays from the tribe of Bani Salamah. Jabir used to say afterwards, `By Allah, it is as if I am looking at him now next to the shoulder of his camel taking refuge behind it, so that the people did not see him.' Soon afterwards, news came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ that the story of `Uthman's death was not true."" Al-Bukhari recorded that Nafi` said, ""People said that `Abdullah bin `Umar embraced Islam before `Umar, but this is not true. What happened is that on the Day of Hudaybiyyah, `Umar sent `Abdullah to bring his horse that he kept with a man from Al-Ansar, so he could use it to fight. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was then taking the pledge from the Muslims under the tree while `Umar was unaware. So, `Abdullah conducted his pledge and fetched the horse and brought it to `Umar, who was wearing his armor in preparation for battle. `Abdullah told `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was accepting the pledge under the tree. `Umar proceeded with `Abdullah and gave his pledge to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. This is why some people thought that `Abdullah bin `Umar embraced Islam before `Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both."" Al-Bukhari also recorded Ibn `Umar saying that, the people who were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ scattered under the shade of trees. Suddenly, the people gathered around the Prophet and `Umar said, ""O `Abdullah! Investigate why the people are gathering around Allah's Messenger ﷺ."" Ibn `Umar found the people giving their pledge. He gave his pledge, then went back and told `Umar, who also went and gave his pledge. In a Hadith collected by Muslim, Jabir bin `Abdullah said, ""On the day of Al-Hudaybiyyah, we were one thousand and four hundred. We gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet while `Umar was holding the Prophet's hand under the tree, which was a Samurah (a kind of thorny tree). We gave the pledge to him not to run away (from battle). We did not give the pledge to die."" Muslim recorded that Ma`qil bin Yasar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""On the day of the Tree, while the Prophet was taking the pledge from the people, I was holding a branch of that tree away from his head. We were fourteen hundred. We did not give him our pledge to die, but gave the pledge not to run from battle."" However, Al-Bukhari recorded that Salamah bin Al-Akwa`, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ""I gave the pledge to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ under the tree."" Yazid asked him, ""O Abu Maslamah, to what did you pledge at that time"" Salamah said, ""To die!"" Al-Bukhari also collected a Hadith from Salamah bin Al-Akwa` that he said, ""I gave my pledge to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on the day of Hudaybiyyah. I stood to the side and the Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا سَلَمَةُ أَلَا تُبَايِعُ؟»</p><p>(Why not give the pledge, O Salamah) and I said, `I did.' He said,</p><p>«أَقْبِلْ فَبَايِع»</p><p>(Come and give pledge). I went close to him and gave him my pledge.""' Salamah was asked, ""What was the pledge that you gave then, O Salamah"" Salamah said, ""To die."" Muslim collected this Hadith as well, while Al-Bukhari collected from `Abbad bin Tamim that the pledge they gave was to die. Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Salamah bin Al-Akwa`, may Allah be pleased with him said, ""We went to Al-Hudaybiyyah with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and we numbered fourteen hundred at that time. We reached the well and found around fifty sheep drinking from it, but its water was barely sufficient for them. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat on its rim, invoked Allah and spat in the well and its water gushed out. We made our animals drink from it and also drank from it. Next, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called the people to give the pledge when he was under the tree, and I was among the first to give the pledge to him. The remaining people then started giving the pledge. When about half the people have given the pledge, the Messenger ﷺ said to me,</p><p>«بَايِعْنِي يَا سَلَمَة»</p><p>(Give me the pledge, O Salamah!) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! I have already pledged my pledge in the first group of people.' He said,</p><p>«وَأَيْضًا»</p><p>(Do it again.) So I pledged my pledge again. He also saw that I was not wearing any armor and gave me some. He went on accepting the pledge from the people. When they were about to finish, he said,</p><p>«أَلَا تُبَايِـــعُ يَا سَلَمَةُ؟»</p><p>(Will you not give me your pledge, O Salamah!) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! I have given you the pledge in the beginning and the middle. ' He said,</p><p>«وَأَيْضًا»</p><p>(Do it again,) I gave him my pledge for a third time. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked me,</p><p>«يَا سَلَمَةُ أَيْنَ حَجَفَتُكَ أَوْ دَرَقَتُكَ الَّتِي أَعْطَيْتُكَ؟»</p><p>(Where is the armor that I gave you O Salamah) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! `Amir met me and I found that he did not have a shield, so I gave it to him.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ laughed and said to me,</p><p>«إِنَّكَ كَالَّذِي قَالَ الْأَوَّلُ اللْهُمَّ أَبْغِنِي حَبِيبًا هُوَ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِنْ نَفْسِي»</p><p>(You are just like the man of old times who said, `O Allah! Give me a dear person who is dearer to me than myself!') Then the idolators of Makkah sent a delegation asking for a peace treaty, and we agreed to make peace. I used to work for Talhah bin `Ubaydullah, may Allah be pleased with him, by providing water for his horse. For taking care of it, Talhah gave me a portion of his food. I had left my family and wealth and migrated to Allah and His Messenger (so I was poor). After the people of Makkah and us conducted peace and were freely mingling with each other, I went by a tree, removed its thorny branches and rested under its shade. Four of the idolators of Makkah stood close to me and started mentioning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in an improper way and I hated being close to them. So, I moved under the shade of another tree. They hanged their weapons and rested under it. Meanwhile, a caller shouted these words from the bottom of the valley, `O Emigrants! Ibn Zunaym was killed,' so I held my sword and went after the four idolators. They were asleep, so I took possession of their weapons and held them in my hand, saying, `By He Who has honored the face of Muhammad ﷺ, if any one of you raises his head, I will strike that which holds his eyes!' I brought them to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, while my uncle `Amir brought another man, an idolator, whose name was Mikraz, and I and my uncle brought the men to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The number of captured idolators swelled to seventy. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked at them and said,</p><p>«دَعُوهُمْ يَكُنْ لَهُمْ بَدْءُ الْفُجُورِ وَثِنَاه»</p><p>(Let them go, for theirs will be the initiation of hostilities and its burden.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forgave them and Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى كَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ عَنْهُم بِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ مِن بَعْدِ أَنْ أَظْفَرَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them.)48:24"" Muslim collected a narration that is the same or similar. The Two Sahihs recorded that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, ""My father was among those who gave the pledge to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ under the tree. He said, `In the following year, we went for Hajj and we could not find the tree.' Therefore, if you know where that tree is, then you have more knowledge!"" Abu Bakr Al-Humaydi recorded that Jabir said, ""When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called the people to the pledge, we found a man from our tribe whose name is Al-Jadd bin Qays, hiding under the shoulder of his camel."" Muslim collected this Hadith. Al-Humaydi also recorded that `Amr said that he heard Jabir say, ""On the day of Hudaybiyyah, we were one thousand and four hundred and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to us,</p><p>«أَنْتُمْ خَيْرُ أَهْلِ الْأَرْضِ الْيَوْم»</p><p>(Today, you are the best people on the earth.)"" Jabir went on saying, ""If I still had my sight, I would have shown you the tree."" Sufyan commented that the Companions later on differed over the location of the tree of Al-Hudaybiyyah; the Two Sahihs collected this statement from him. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا يَدْخُلُ النَّارَ أَحَدٌ مِمَّنْ بَايَعَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَة»</p><p>(None among those who gave the pledge under the tree shall enter Hellfire.) `Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ يَصْعَدُ الثَّنِيَّةَ ثَنِيَّةَ الْمُرَارِ فَإِنَّهُ يُحَطُّ عَنْهُ مَا حُطَّ عَنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(He who ascends Thaniyyah (i.e. a mountainous pass), the Thaniyyah of Al-Murar, will have as much of his sins relieved for him as the sins that were relieved from the Children of Israel.) The first to ascend that hill were the horsemen of (the Ansar tribe of) Banu Al-Khazraj, then the Muslims followed suit. The Prophet said,</p><p>«كُلُّكُمْ مَغْفُورٌ لَهُ إِلَّا صَاحِبَ الْجَمَلِ الْأَحْمَر»</p><p>(All of you will be forgiven, except the owner of the red camel.) We said to him, ""Come, let the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoke Allah to forgive you,"" but he said, ""By Allah! Finding my lost camel is dearer to me than having your companion invoke Allah to forgive me. "" That man was only looking for his lost camel. Muslim collected this Hadith from Ubaydullah (from Jabir). Muslim also recorded that Abu Az-Zubayr heard Jabir say, ""Umm Mubashshir told me that she heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying, while he was with Hafsah,</p><p>«لَا يَدْخُلُ النَّارَ إِنْ شَاءَ اللهُ تَعَالَى مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الشَّجَرَةِ الَّذِينَ بَايَعُوا تَحْتَهَا، أَحَد»</p><p>(Allah willing, none of the Companions of the tree, who gave the pledge under it, will ever enter Hellfire.) She said, `No, O Allah's Messenger.' The Prophet rebuked her but Hafsah said,</p><p>وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا</p><p>(There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell))(19:71) but the Prophet responded,</p><p>«قَدْ قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى:</p><p>ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّنَذَرُ الظَّـلِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيّاً »</p><p>(Allah the Exalted said next, (Then We shall save those who had Taqwa and We shall leave the wrongdoers therein on their knees.))(19:71)"" Muslim also narrated that Jabir said, ""A slave of Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah came to the Messenger complaining against Hatib and saying, `O Allah's Messenger! Hatib shall surely enter Hell.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied,</p><p>«كَذَبْتَ لَا يَدْخُلُهَا فَإِنَّهُ قَدْ شَهِدَ بَدْرًا وَالْحُدَيْبِيَّة»</p><p>(You lie, he shall never enter the Fire; he participated in Badr and Al-Hudaybiyyah.) This is why Allah the Exalted said while praising these Companions,</p>"

Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىِ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Make not (a decision) in advance before Allah and His Messenger,) meaning, do not rush in making decisions before him, rather, follow his lead in all matters. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented;</p><p>لاَ تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىِ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(Make not (a decision) in advance before Allah and His Messenger,) ""Do not say anything that contradicts the Qur'an and Sunnah."" Qatadah commented, ""We were told that some people used to say, `Revelation should be sent down about such and such matters,' and, `such and such practices should be rendered allowed.' Allah the Exalted disliked this attitude."" Allah said,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(and have Taqwa of Allah.) meaning, `in what He has ordered you;'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is Hearing,) `your statements,'</p><p>عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Knowing.) `your intentions.' Allah said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَرْفَعُواْ أَصْوَتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ النَّبِىِّ</p><p>(O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet,) This contains another kind of favorable behavior. Allah the Exalted is teaching the believers that they should not raise their voices above the voice of the Prophet . It was stated that this Ayah was revealed about Abu Bakr and `Umar. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abi Mulaykah said, ""The two righteous ones, Abu Bakr and `Umar, almost earned destruction when they raised their voices before the Prophet who was receiving the delegation of Bani Tamim. One of them recommended Al-Aqra` bin Habis the member of the Banu Mujashi` while the other recommended another man. Nafi` (a subnarrator) said: ""I don't remember his name."" Abu Bakr said to `Umar, `You only wanted to contradict me,' while `Umar said, `I did not intend to contradict you.' Their voices then became loud, thereupon Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَرْفَعُواْ أَصْوَتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ النَّبِىِّ وَلاَ تَجْهَرُواْ لَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ كَجَهْرِ بَعْضِكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ أَن تَحْبَطَ أَعْمَـلُكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should be thwarted while you perceive not.)"" `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said, ""After that, `Umar's voice was so low that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had to ask him to repeat what he said so that he could understand what he was saying to him."" `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr did not mention the same regarding his father, Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him. Muslim did not collect this Hadith. In another narration collected by Al-Bukhari, he said that a delegation from the tribe of Banu Tamim came to the Prophet and that Abu Bakr recommended Al-Qa`qa` bin Ma`bad to be appointed as their leader, while `Umar recommended Al-Aqra` bin Habis. Muslim did not collect this narration. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""The Prophet missed Thabit bin Qays and a man said, `O Allah's Messenger! I will find out about his news.' That man went to Thabit and found him sitting at home with his head lowered and asked him, `What is the matter' Thabit said, `An evil matter!' And he said that he used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet . He feared that his good deeds would be useless and he would be among the people of the Fire. The man went back to the Prophet and conveyed Thabit's statement and returned to Thabit with a wonderfully good news. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اذْهَبْ إِلَيْهِ فَقُلْ لَهُ: إِنَّكَ لَسْتَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَلَكِنَّكَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Go back to him and tell him this news; you are not among the people of the Fire. Rather, you are among the dwellers of Paradise.)"" Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith with this wording. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""When this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَرْفَعُواْ أَصْوَتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ النَّبِىِّ</p><p>(O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet), until,</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(while you perceive not), Thabit bin Qays bin Ash-Shammas, whose voice was loud, said, `I was the one who raised his voice above the voice of Allah's Messenger ﷺ. I am among the dwellers of the Fire. My good deeds have been done in vain.' He remained in his house feeling distressed, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ noticed his absence. So some men went to Thabit and said to him, `The Prophet noticed your absence. What is the matter with you' Thabit said, `I used to raise my voice above the voice of the Prophet and speak loudly in front of him. My deeds have been rendered useless and I am among the people of the Fire.' They went to the Prophet and told him what Thabit said and the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا، بَلْ هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Nay, he is among the dwellers of Paradise.)"" Anas commented, ""We used to see Thabit walk among us knowing that he was (to be) among the dwellers of Paradise. During the battle of Yamamah, our forces suffered retreat. Suddenly, Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas came, having put on his Hanut and shrouds, and said, `The worst habit is the one you acquire from your enemy and do not set a bad example for your companions.' And he went on fighting until he was martyred, may Allah be pleased with him."" Allah then prohibited speaking to the Prophet in a loud voice, just as one speaks loudly to another in a way that offends him. Instead, they were required to speak to him in terms of respect, honor and calmness. This is why Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَجْهَرُواْ لَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ كَجَهْرِ بَعْضِكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ</p><p>(nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another,) just as He said in another Ayah,</p><p>لاَّ تَجْعَلُواْ دُعَآءَ الرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَآءِ بَعْضِكُمْ بَعْضاً</p><p>(Make not the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one of another.) (24:63) Allah's statement,</p><p>أَن تَحْبَطَ أَعْمَـلُكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(lest your deeds should be thwarted while you perceive not.) means, `We ordered you to refrain from raising your voices to the Prophet , so that he will not get angry with you, because in doing so, you will also anger Allah.' The good deeds of he who caused the Prophet's anger will become useless without him even knowing. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith that states,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ رِضْوَانِ اللهِ تَعَالَى لَا يُلْقِي لَهَا بَالًا، يُكْتَبُ لَهُ بِهَا الْجَنَّةُ، وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ سَخَطِ اللهِ تَعَالَى لَا يُلْقِي لَهَا بَالًا، يَهْوِي بِهَا فِي النَّارِ أَبْعَدَ مَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْض»</p><p>(Verily, a man might utter a word that pleases Allah the Exalted, even though he does not recognize the significance of his word, and on its account Paradise is written for him. Verily, a man might utter a word carelessly that angers Allah the Exalted, and on its account, he is cast in the Fire farther than the distance between the heavens and earth.) Allah then ordains lowering one's voice before the Messenger ﷺ and encourages, directs and recommends this better behavior.</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَغُضُّونَ أَصْوَتَهُمْ عِندَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ امْتَحَنَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ لِلتَّقْوَى</p><p>(Verily, those who lower their voices in the presence of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, they are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for Taqwa.) whose hearts have been purified by Allah and made as a residence and dwelling for the Taqwa,</p><p>لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(For them is forgiveness and a great reward.) Imam Ahmad recorded in the Book of Az-Zuhd that Mujahid said, ""Someone wrote to `Umar, `O Leader of the faithful! Who is better, a man who does not feel the desire to commit a sin and does not commit it, or a man who feels desire to commit a sin, but does not commit it' `Umar replied, `He who feels desire to commit a sin, but does not commit it,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ امْتَحَنَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ لِلتَّقْوَى لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(they are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for Taqwa. For them is forgiveness and a great reward.)""'</p>"

4616,"<h2>Admonishing Those Who call the Prophet from behind Dwellings</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Most Blessed admonished those, such as the uncivilized bedouins, who used to call to the Prophet from behind the dwellings which belong to his wives,</p><p>أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(most of them have no sense.) Allah the Exalted and Most Honored then ordains the better behavior in this regard,</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ صَبَرُواْ حَتَّى تَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِمْ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ</p><p>(And if they had patience till you could come out to them, it would have been better for them.) it would have earned them the better benefit of this life and the Hereafter. Allah, Worthy of all praise, then encourages them to turn to Him in repentance.</p><p>وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.) It was reported that this Ayah was revealed about Al-Aqra` bin Habis At-Tamimi, may Allah be pleased with him, according to more than one source. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Aqra` bin Habis said that he called the Messenger of Allah ﷺ from behind his dwellings, saying, ""O Muhammad! O Muhammad!"" ""O Allah's Messenger!"" according to another narration, but the Messenger did not answer him, Al-Aqra` said, ""O Allah's Messenger.</p><h2>Investigating the Reliability of the News conveyed by Wicked People</h2><p>Allah the Exalted ordered investigating the news that sinners and the wicked bring, to make sure of its authenticity. Otherwise, if the sinner's word is taken for granted and a decision is based on it, regardless of whether the information is true or not, the authorities will be taking the lead of the sinners. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored forbade taking the path of the corrupted and sinners. This is why groups of the scholars of Hadith refuse to accept narrations from narrators whose reliability is unknown, for they might be from among the wicked people, in reality.</p><h2>The Prophet's Decision is Better</h2><p>Allah said,</p>"

Allah's statement next,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الرَشِدُونَ</p><p>(7 cont. - Such are they who are the rightly guided.) those who have these qualities are the rightly guided ones whom Allah has granted guidance and correctness. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Rifa`ah Az-Zuraqi said that his father said, ""During the battle of Uhud, when the idolators retreated, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اسْتَوُوا حَتْى أُثْنِيَ عَلَى رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَل»</p><p>(Stay in straight lines so that I praise my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.)

4621,"<h2>Making Peace between Disputing Muslims</h2><p>Allah commands making peace between Muslims that fight each other,</p><p>وَإِن طَآئِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُواْ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And if two parties among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both.) Therefore, Allah calls both opposing groups among Muslims, believers, although they are fighting each other. Al-Bukhari and other scholars relied on this Hadith as evidence that committing a sin does not nullify faith, no matter how major the sin is. This creed contradicts the creed of the Khawarij sect and those who accepted their idea, such as the Mu`tazilah sect. Al-Bukhari narrated that Al-Hasan said that Abu Bakrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech on the Minbar while Al-Hasan bin `Ali was with him. He was repeatedly looking at Al-Hasan and then at the people; then said,</p><p>«إِنَّ ابْنِي هذَا سَيِّدٌ وَلَعَلَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى أَنْ يُصْلِحَ بِهِ بَيْنَ فِئَتَيْنِ عَظِيمَتَيْنِ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِين»</p><p>(Verily, this son of mine is a Sayyid (chief or master), and may Allah make peace between two great groups of Muslims through him.) What the Prophet said, occurred. Al-Hasan brought peace between the people of Ash-Sham and `Iraq, after they fought tremendous wars and frightening battles. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الأُخْرَى فَقَـتِلُواْ الَّتِى تَبْغِى حَتَّى تَفِىءَ إِلَى أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah.) means, until the rebellious group refers to the commands of Allah and His Messenger for judgement and they listen to and obey the truth. There is a Hadith in the Sahih in which Anas states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«انْصُرْ أَخَاكَ ظَالِمًا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا»</p><p>(Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is oppressed.) ""I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! It is right that I help him if he is oppressed, but how should I help him if he is an oppressor' He said,</p><p>«تَمْنَعُهُ مِنَ الظُّلْمِ فَذَاكَ نَصْرُكَ إِيَّاه»</p><p>(By preventing him from oppressing others; this is how you help him in this case.)"" Sa`id bin Jubayr said that tribes of Aws and Khazraj once got in a scuffle using date tree branches and slippers. Allah revealed this honorable Ayah commanding them to make peace between them. As-Suddi said, ""A man from Al-Ansar, whose name was `Imran, had a wife called Umm Zayd. She wanted to visit her family, but her husband prevented her from visiting them by locking her in an upper room. So, none of her family could visit or see her. She sent someone to her family. They came, took her down from the room and wanted to take her away. Her husband was absent at the time, so his family called on their people. Their cousins came to help prevent the wife from going with her family. A push and shove situation occurred that led to them fighting using slippers. This Ayah was then revealed in their case, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent someone to bring peace between them, and they both agreed to resort to the decision of Allah the Exalted."" The statement of Allah the Exalted, next,</p><p>فَإِن فَآءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p><p>(Then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable.) means, be fair in your judgement regarding the dispute that occurred between them,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded, that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ فِي الدُّنْيَا عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ لُؤْلُؤٍ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الرَّحْمنِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بِمَا أَقْسَطُوا فِي الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Verily, those who are equitable in this life, will be on podiums made of pearls before Ar-Rahman, the Exalted and Most Honored, on account of their fairness in this life.) An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ</p><p>(The believers are but a brotherhood.) means, all of them are brothers in Islam. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْمُسْلِمُ أَخُو الْمُسْلِمِ لَا يَظْلِمُهُ وَلَا يُسْلِمُه»</p><p>(The Muslim is the brother of the Muslim, he is not unjust with him nor does he forsake him.) In the Sahih,</p><p>«وَاللهُ فِي عَوْنِ الْعَبْدِ مَا كَانَ الْعَبْدُ فِي عَوْنِ أَخِيه»</p><p>(Allah helps the servant as long as the servant helps his brother.) Also in the Sahih:</p><p>«إِذَا دَعَا الْمُسْلِمُ لِأَخِيهِ بِظَهْرِ الْغَيْبِ قَالَ الْمَلَكُ: آمِينَ وَلَكَ بِمِثْلِه»</p><p>(If the Muslim invokes Allah for the benefit of his absent brother, the angel says afterwards, ""Amin, and for you the same."") There are many Hadiths with this meaning, such as, in the Sahih,</p><p>«مَثَلُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فِي تَوَادِّهِمْ وَتَرَاحُمِهِمْ وَتَوَاصُلِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ الْجَسَدِ الْوَاحِدِ، إِذَا اشْتَكَى مِنْهُ عُضْوٌ تَدَاعَى لَهُ سَائِرُ الْجَسَدِ بِالْحُمَّى وَالسَّهَر»</p><p>(The parable of the believers in relation to the kindness, mercy and compassion they have for each other, is that of the body: when an organ of it falls ill, the rest of the body responds with fever and sleeplessness.) And also in Sahih.</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ كَالْبُنْيَانِ يَشُدُّ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا»</p><p>(A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other.) The Prophet then clasped his hands with the fingers interlaced. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ</p><p>(So make reconciliation between your brothers, ) refers to the two groups that fight each other,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(and have Taqwa of Allah) in all of your affairs,</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</p><p>(that you may receive mercy.) and this is a promise from Allah that He will grant mercy to those who fear and obey Him.</p>"

4631,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Beginning of the Mufassal Section of the Qur'an</h2><p>This Surah is the first Surah in the Mufassal section of the Qur'an, according to the correct view. It is said that the Mufassal starts with Surat Al-Hujurat. Some common people say that the Mufassal starts with Surah `Amma An-Naba, (chapter 78), however, this is not true because none of the respected scholars ever supported this opinion. Aws (bin Hudhayfah) said; ""I asked the Companions of Allah's Messenger ﷺ how they divided the Qur'an. They said; `Three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, and the Mufassal section as one.' "" This was recorded by Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad. If one counts forty-eight Surahs, the next Surah will be Surah Qaf. The details are as follows: The first three Surahs are Al-Baqarah (chapter 2), Al `Imran (3), then An-Nisa' (4). The five are Al-Ma'idah (5), Al-An`am (6), Al-A`raf (7), Al-Anfal (8) and Bara'ah (or At-Tawbah) (9). The seven next Surahs are Surah Yunus (10), Hud (11), Yusuf (12), Ar-Ra`d (13), Ibrahim (14), Al-Hijr (15) and An-Nahl (16). The nine next Surahs are, Subhan (or Al-Isra' (17), Al-Kahf (18), Maryam (19), Ta Ha (20), Al-Anbiya' (21), Al-Hajj (22), Al-Mu`minun (23), An-Nur (24) and Al-Furqan (25). The next eleven Surahs are Surat Ash-Shu`ara (26), An-Naml (27), Al-Qasas (28), Al-`Ankabut (29), Ar-Rum (30), Luqman (31), Alif Lam Mim As-Sajdah (32), Al-Ahzab (33), Saba' (34), Fatir (35) and Ya Sin (36). The next thirteen are Surat As-Saffat (37), Sad (38), Az-Zumar (39), Ghafir (40), Ha Mim As-Sajdah (or Fussilat) (41), Ash-Shura (42), Az-Zukhruf (43), Ad-Dukhan (44), Al-Jathiyah (45), Al-Ahqaf (46), Al-Qital (or Muhammad) (47), Al-Fath (48) and Al-Hujurat (49). After that comes the Mufassal section, according to the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. Therefore, Surah Qaf (chapter 50) is the first of the Mufassal, just as we stated, and all praise is due to Allah and all favors are from Him.</p><h2>The Virtues of Surah Qaf</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Abu Waqid Al-Laythi, ""What did the Prophet recite during the `Id Prayer"" Abu Waqid said, ""Surah Qaf and Surat Iqtarabat i.e. Surat Al-Qamar (54)."" Muslim and the Four Collectors of the Sunan collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Umm Hisham bint Harithah said, ""For around two years, or a year and a part of another year, our oven and the oven of the Prophet was one and the same. I memorized Surah,</p><p>ق وَالْقُرْءَانِ الْمَجِيدِ</p><p>(Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an.) from the tongue of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who used to recite it every Friday while standing on the Minbar delivering the Friday sermon to the people."" Muslim collected this Hadith. Abu Dawud also recorded that the daughter of Al-Harith bin An-Nu`man said, ""I only memorized Surah Qaf from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who used to recite it in every Friday Khutbah. Our oven and the oven of the Messenger was one and the same."" Muslim and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite this Surah during large gatherings such as the `Ids and during Friday sermons. He did so because this Surah contains news of the beginning of creation, Resurrec- tion, the Return, Standing (before Allah), the Reckoning, Paradise, the Fire, Allah's reward and punishment, lessons of encouragement, and lessons of discouragement. Allah knows best.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p>ق</p><p>(Qaf.) which is one of the letters of the alphabet that are mentioned in the beginning of some Surahs, such as,</p><p>ص</p><p>(Sad.) (38:1)</p><p>ن</p><p>(Nun. ) (68:1)</p><p>الم</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim.) (2:1),</p><p>حـم</p><p>(Ha Mim.) (40:1), and</p><p>طس</p><p>(Ta Sin) (28:1) and etc., Mujahid and several others said this. We also discussed this in the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah, and therefore, it is not necessary to repeat it here.</p><h2>The Disbelievers wonder at the Message and Resurrection Allah said,</h2><p>وَالْقُرْءَانِ الْمَجِيدِ</p><p>(By the Glorious Qur'an.) means by the Honorable and Great Qur'an, which,</p><p>لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ</p><p>(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.)(41:42) The subject of the oath contained in this Ayah is specified afterwards, even though it does not appear by word, emphasizing prophethood, resurrection and affirming that they are true. There are similar kinds of oaths in the Qur'an, whose subject is included in the meaning but not by word, such as,</p><p>ص وَالْقُرْءَانِ ذِى الذِّكْرِ - بَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِى عِزَّةٍ وَشِقَاقٍ</p><p>(Sad. By the Qur'an full of reminding. Nay, those who disbelieve are in false pride and opposition.)(38:1-2) Allah said here,</p><p>ق وَالْقُرْءَانِ الْمَجِيدِ - بَلْ عَجِبُواْ أَن جَآءَهُمْ مُّنذِرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَقَالَ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا شَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ</p><p>(Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an. Nay, they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. So the disbelievers say: ""This is a strange thing!"") They wondered at the wisdom behind sending a Messenger who is a human being. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said in another Ayah</p><p>أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنذِرِ النَّاسَ</p><p>(Is it a wonder for mankind that We have sent Our revelation to a man from among themselves (saying): ""Warn mankind."") (10:2), meaning, this is not strange, for Allah chooses Messengers from angels and humans. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored mentioned that the disbelievers also wondered about the Resurrection and discounted its coming,</p><p>أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً ذَلِكَ رَجْعُ بَعِيدٌ</p><p>(When we are dead and have become dust. That is a far return.) They said, `after we die, disintegrate, with our organs torn apart and we become dust, how can we be brought back to our original shape and bodies,'</p><p>ذَلِكَ رَجْعُ بَعِيدٌ</p><p>(That is a far return.) `it is not likely that it will ever occur.' They thought that Resurrection was far from happening and will never occur. Allah the Exalted responded to their statement by saying,</p><p>قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ الاٌّرْضَ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(We know that which the earth takes of them.) meaning, `We know what the earth consumes of their dead bodies.' Where and how the bodies disintegrated, what they turned into and how they have become, all of this is never absent from Allah's knowledge.</p><p>وَعِندَنَا كِتَـبٌ حَفِيظٌ</p><p>(and with Us is a Book preserved,) `that keeps all records. Therefore, Our knowledge is encompassing and the Book of decrees has everything precisely recorded in it. Al-`Awfi narrated that `Abdullah bin `Abbas commented on the statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ الاٌّرْضَ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(We know that which the earth takes of them,) ""It refers to what the earth consumes of their flesh, skin, bones and hair."" A similar view was recorded from Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and several others. Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, explained the reason behind their disbelief, rebellion and discounting the possibility of what is truly possible,</p><p>بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِالْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ فَهُمْ فِى أَمْرٍ مَّرِيجٍ</p><p>(Nay, but they have denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a Marij state.) This is the state of all those who defy the Truth: whatever they say and utter after denying the Truth, is utterly false. Marij means, in disarray, in a confused state and defying the characteristics of the Truth. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ لَفِى قَوْلٍ مُّخْتَلِفٍ - يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ</p><p>(Certainly, you have different ideas. Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.)(51:8-9)</p>"

Allah says that observing the creation of the heavens and earth and all the great things that He has placed in them provides insight, proof and a lesson for every penitent servant who submits in humbleness and repentance to Allah feeling fear, in awe of Him. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَنَزَّلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً مُّبَـرَكاً</div><p>(And We send down blessed water from the sky,) meaning beneficial,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَأَنبَتْنَا بِهِ جَنَّـتٍ</div><p>(then We produce therewith Jannat), means special and public parks, gardens, etc.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَحَبَّ الْحَصِيدِ</div><p>(and grain that are reaped) grains that are harvested for food and for storage for later use,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بَـسِقَـتٍ</div><p>(And date palms Basiqat,) meaning, tall and high, according to the explanation reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi.

However, when rain falls upon it, it is stirred to life; it swells and produces all of the lovely pairs such as flowers and the like -- amazing on account of their beauty. All of this comes into existence after the land was without greenery, yet it was stirred back to life and became green. Indeed, this should provide proof of Resurrection after death and disintegration; thus Allah resurrects the dead. This sign of Allah's ability that is seen and witnessed is greater than the denial of those who discount the possibility of Resurrection. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said in other Ayat,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ</div><p>(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind;) (40:57),</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَعْىَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى بَلَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ </div><p>(Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is able to give life to the dead Yes, He surely is Able to do all things.)(46:33) and,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى الاٌّرْضَ خَـشِعَةً فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ إِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ </div><p>(And among His signs (is this), that you see the earth barren; but when We send down water to it, it is stirred to life and growth.

Ibn Al-Kawwa stood up and said, ""O Leader of the faithful! What is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالذَرِيَـتِ ذَرْواً</p><p>(By the scattering Dhariyat),"" and `Ali said, ""The wind."" The man asked,</p><p>فَالْحَـمِلَـتِ وِقْراً</p><p>""(And the laden Hamilat)"" `Ali said, ""The clouds."" The man again asked,</p><p>فَالْجَـرِيَـتِ يُسْراً</p><p>""(And the steady Jariyat)"" `Ali said, ""The ships."" The man asked,</p><p>فَالْمُقَسِّمَـتِ أَمْراً</p><p>""(And the distributors of command)"" `Ali said, it refers to ""The angels."" Some scholars said that Al-Jariyat Yusra refers to the stars that float in their orbits with ease. This would mean that the things mentioned were ascendant in their order, beginning with the lower, then mentioning the higher one after that, etc. The winds bring the clouds, the stars are above them and the angels who distribute by Allah's order are above that, and they descend with Allah's legislative orders and the decrees He determines. These Ayat contain a vow from Allah that Resurrection shall come to pass. Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَصَـدِقٌ</p><p>(Verily, that which you are promised is surely true.), it is a truthful promise,</p><p>وَإِنَّ الدِّينَ</p><p>(And verily, Ad-Din) the Recompense,</p><p>لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(will occur), it will surely come to pass. Then Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ الْحُبُكِ</p><p>(By the heaven full of Hubuk,) Ibn `Abbas said; ""Full of beauty, grace, magnificence and perfection."" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Salih, As-Suddi, Qatadah, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others said similarly. Ad-Dahhak, Al-Minhal bin `Amr and others said, ""The meandering of the water, sand and plants when the wind passes over them; carving paths out of them, that is the Hubuk."" All of these sayings return to the same meaning, that of beauty and complexity. The sky is high above us, clear yet thick, firmly structured, spacious and graceful, beautified with stars such as the sun and orbiting planets such as the moon and the planets of the solar system.</p><h2>The Differing Claims of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ لَفِى قَوْلٍ مُّخْتَلِفٍ</p><p>(Certainly, you have different ideas.) Allah says, `you disbelievers who deny the Messengers have different and confused opinions that do not connect or conform to each other.' Qatadah commented on the Ayah, ""You have different ideas about the Qur'an. Some of you agree that it is true while some others deny this fact."" Allah said,</p><p>يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ</p><p>(Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.) Allah says, these confused and different opinions only fool those who are inwardly misguided. Surely, such falsehood is accepted, embraced and it becomes the source of confusion only for those who are misguided and originally liars, the fools who have no sound comprehension, as Allah said,</p><p>فَإِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ - مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَـتِنِينَ - إِلاَّ مَنْ هُوَ صَالِ الْجَحِيمِ</p><p>(So, verily you and those whom you worship cannot lead astray, except those who are predetermined to burn in Hell!)(37:161-163) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and As-Suddi said:</p><p>يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ</p><p>(Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.) ""He who is misguided is led astray from it. "" Allah said;</p><p>قُتِلَ الْخَرَصُونَ</p><p>(Cursed be Al-Kharrasun), Mujahid said; ""The liars. This is similar to what is mentioned in (Surah) `Abasa:</p><p>قُتِلَ الإِنسَـنُ مَآ أَكْفَرَهُ</p><p>(Be cursed man! How ungrateful he is!)(80:17) Al-Kharrasun are those who claim that they will never be brought back to life, doubting the coming of Resurrection."" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>قُتِلَ الْخَرَصُونَ</p><p>(Cursed be Al-Kharrasun), ""Cursed be the doubters."" Mu`adh said similarly, may Allah be pleased with him. During one of his speeches he said, ""Destroyed be the doubters."" Qatadah said, ""Al-Kharrasun are the people of doubt and suspicion."" Allah said;</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى غَمْرَةٍ سَـهُونَ</p><p>(Who are under a cover of Sahun,) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said; ""In disbelief and doubt, they are heedless and playful."" Allah said,</p><p>يَسْـَلُونَ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</p><p>(They ask: ""When will be the Day of Ad-Din"") They utter this statement in denial, stubbornness, doubt and suspicion. Allah the Exalted replied,</p><p>يَوْمَ هُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ يُفْتَنُونَ</p><p>((It will be) a Day when they will be Yuftanun in the Fire!) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and several others said that Yuftanun means punished. Mujahid said: ""Just as gold is forged in the fire."" A group of others also including Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Zayd bin Aslam, and Sufyan Ath-Thawri said, ""They will be burnt.""</p><p>ذُوقُواْ فِتْنَتَكُمْ</p><p>(Taste you your trial!), Mujahid said, ""Your burning"" while others said, ""Your punishment.""</p><p>هَـذَا الَّذِى كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ</p><p>(This is what you used to ask to be hastened!)

Surely, I have never heard a more beautiful voice or recitation than his recitation."" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that includes Malik. Al-Bukhari recorded that Umm Salamah said, ""I complained of being ill to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he said,</p><p>«طُوفِي مِنْ وَرَاءِ النَّاسِ وَأَنْتِ رَاكِبَة»</p><p>(Perform Tawaf (of the Ka`bah) behind the crowd, while you are riding.) So, I performed Tawaf while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was praying beside the House, reciting At-Tur.""</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Allah swears that the Coming of Torment is Near</h2><p>Allah swears by His creation, a testimony to His great ability, that His torment will surely befall His enemies; they will have no way of escaping it. At-Tur is the mount that has trees, similar to the mount where Allah spoke to Musa, while Musa was on it, and the mount on which Allah started the prophethood of `Isa. A mount that does not have trees is called Jabal, not Tur. Allah said,</p><p>وَكِتَـبٍ مُّسْطُورٍ</p><p>(And by the Book inscribed), it is said that it means Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, (the Preserved Table). It is also said that is refers to the divinely revealed inscribed Books that people recite, and this is why Allah said,</p><p>فِى رَقٍّ مَّنْشُورٍ - وَالْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ</p><p>(In parchment unrolled. And by Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.) In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) ""Meaning the heaven."" Sufyan added, ""Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)"" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth. Masjur, means, the sea will be kindled with fire on the Day of Resurrection just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)(81:6) i.e., it will be kindled with fire and become a raging fire that surrounds the people in the gathering area, this was reported by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib from `Ali bin Abi Talib. It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, ""Masjur is the `filled sea.""' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, ""The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled."" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, ""One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass. There is none that can avert it.) `Umar said, `By the Lord of the Ka`bah, this is a true vow.' `Umar dismounted his donkey and sat next to a wall for a while. He then went back to his house and fell ill for a month. During his illness, the people would visit him, not knowing what caused his illness."" May Allah be pleased with `Umar.</p><h2>Describing the Day of Torment, the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً</p><p>(On the Day when Tamur the heaven Mawr) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: ""Shaking violently."" Also from Ibn `Abbas, ""Split."" Mujahid said: ""Spin violently."" Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, saying, ""The earth will violently spin and move by the command of Allah, and its areas will violently move towards each other."" This was preferred by Ibn Jarir, because of the meaning of the word, Mawra, which denotes meanings of spinning and shaking. Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, ""They will be violently shoved into the Fire."" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone. Most certainly, Allah recompenses each according to their deeds.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَعِيمٍ - فَـكِهِينَ بِمَآ ءَاتَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ وَوَقَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ عَذَابَ الْجَحِيمِ</p>"

And this Ayah is like Allah's saying;</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِمَوَقِعِ النُّجُومِ - وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ - إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(So, I swear by the setting of the stars. And verily, that is indeed a great oath, if you but know. That is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of all that exists.)(56:75-80) Allah said;</p><p>مَا ضَلَّ صَـحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَى</p><p>(Your companion has neither gone astray nor has erred.) This contains the subject of the oath. This part of the Ayah is the witness that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is sane and a follower of Truth. He is neither led astray, such as in the case of the ignorant who does not proceed on any path with knowledge, nor is he one who erred, such as in the case of the knowledgeable, who knows the Truth, yet deviates from it intentionally to something else. Therefore, Allah exonerated His Messenger and his Message from being similar to the misguided ways of the Christians and the erroneous paths of the Jews, such as knowing the Truth and hiding it, while abiding by falsehood. Rather, he, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, and his glorious Message that Allah has sent him with, are on the perfect straight path, following guidance and what is correct.</p><h2>Muhammad ﷺ was sent as a Mercy for all that exists; He does not speak of His Desire</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَى</p><p>(Nor does he speak of desire), asserting that nothing the Prophet utters is of his own desire or wish,</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ وَحْىٌ يُوحَى</p><p>(It is only a revelation revealed.), means, he only conveys to the people what he was commanded to convey, in its entirety without additions or deletions. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ بِشَفَاعَةِ رَجُلٍ لَيْسَ بِنَبِيَ مِثْلُ الْحَيَّيْنِ أَوْ مِثْلُ أَحَدِ الْحَيَّيْنِ رَبِيعَةَ وَمُضَر»</p><p>(Verily, numbers similar to the two tribes, or one of them, Rabi`ah and Mudar, will enter Paradise on account of the intercession of one man, who is not a Prophet.) A man asked, ""O Allah's Messenger! Is not Rabi`ah a subtribe of Mudar."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا أَقُولُ مَا أَقُول»</p><p>(I said what I said.) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, ""I used to record everything I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ so it would be preserved. The Quraysh discouraged me from this, saying, `You record everything you hear from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, even though he is human and sometimes speaks when he is angry' I stopped recording the Hadiths for a while, but later mentioned what they said to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said,</p><p>«اكْتُبْ، فَوَ الَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا خَرَجَ مِنِّي إِلَّا الْحَق»</p><p>(Write! By He in Whose Hand is my soul, every word that comes out of me is the Truth.)"" Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith.</p>"

4789,"<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, ""The highest horizon where the morning comes from."" Mujahid said, ""It is (the place of) sunrise."" Qatadah said, ""That from which the day comes."" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows."" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, ""The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.""' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of ""at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) ""Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)"" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, ""I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, ""Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings."" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) ""Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)"" Someone else said, ""Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.""</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) ""He saw Allah twice in his heart."" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, ""I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.""' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, ""I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)"" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)"" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge."" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)"" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, ""Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west."" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, ""O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored"" She said, ""Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied."" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, ""And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie."" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, ""And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,"" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, ""However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape."" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, ""I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)""' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, ""Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah."" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

4847,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>The Hadith of Abu Waqid preceded, in which it is mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite Surah Qaf (chapter 53) and Iqtarabat As-Sa`ah (Al-Qamar, chapter 54), during (the `Id Prayers of) Al-Adha and Al-Fitr. The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon</h2><p>Allah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,</p><p>أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</p><p>(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),</p><p>اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)</p><h2>Hadiths about the Last Hour</h2><p>There are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»</p><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, ""We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time."" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,</p><p>«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»</p><p>(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)"" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»</p><p>(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»</p><p>(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, ""Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»</p><p>(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)""' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,</p><p>وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ</p><p>(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split</p><h2>The Narration of Anas bin Malik</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,</p><p>اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ</p><p>(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)"" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them."" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.</p><h2>The Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, ""The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.""' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.</p><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""The moon was split during the time of the Prophet ."" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.

They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others.

Mujahid said, ""An-Najm (the star); the one that is in the sky."" Al-Hasan and Qatadah said similarly.

Allah raised the heavens and put down, or laid, the earth and balanced it with firm mountains, so that it would be stable for its residents that live on it, i.e. the various types and kinds of creatures, different in species, shape, color and language. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Al-An'am means the creatures.</p><p>فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ</p><p>(Therein are fruits,) of various colors, taste and scent,</p><p>وَالنَّخْلُ ذَاتُ الاٌّكْمَامِ</p><p>(and date palms producing Akmam.) Allah mentioned the date tree here specifically because of its benefit, both fresh and dry. Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said said Al-Akmam, means sheathed fruit stalks. Similar was said by more than one of the scholars of Tafsir, it refers to the stalks that the seeds grow in to become a cluster of dates, unripe green dates then they ripen and ripen more. Allah said,</p><p>وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ</p><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf, and Rayhan.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that in,</p><p>وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ</p><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf), `Asf means straw."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""`Asf is green leaves cut from the stem, so it is called `Asf when it dries out."" Similarly, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Malik said that `Asf means straw. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that Rayhan means leaves, while Al-Hasan said that it means sweet-scented plants. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Rayhan means green leaves. The meanings here, and Allah knows best, are the various crops that produce straw, such as wheat and barley, and Rayhan are the leaves that grow on the stems.</p><h2>Mankind is surrounded by Allah's Favors</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ</p><p>(13.

This is like Allah's saying:</p><p>إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا</p><p>(When the earth is shaken with its earthquake.)(99:1) and,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord! Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.)(22:1). Allah said:</p><p>وَبُسَّتِ الْجِبَالُ بَسّاً</p><p>(And the mountains will be powdered to dust,) meaning, relentlessly pulverized. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah and others. Ibn Zayd said: ""The mountains will become just like Allah described them,</p><p>كَثِيباً مَّهِيلاً</p><p>(A heap of sand poured out.)(73:14)."" Allah's saying:</p><p>فَكَانَتْ هَبَآءً مُّنبَثّاً</p><p>(So that they will become floating dust particles.) Abu Ishaq narrated from Al-Harith, from `Ali: ""It will become like the rising dust storm that soon fades away leaving no trace of itself behind."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about Allah's saying:</p><p>فَكَانَتْ هَبَآءً مُّنبَثّاً</p><p>(So that they will become floating dust particles.) ""It describes the rising embers from the fire when it is kindled, but when the embers land, they are extinguished quickly."" `Ikrimah said, ""The floating dust particles that the wind scatters all around,"" while Qatadah said,</p><p>هَبَآءً مُّنبَثّاً</p><p>(floating particles), ""Like the dry parts of trees that the wind scatters all about."" This Ayah is similar to several other Ayat that indicate that the mountains will be moved from their places, demolished and blown off their bases, becoming like carded wool on the Day of Resurrection.</p><h2>Three Categories of People on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَكُنتُمْ أَزْوَاجاً ثَلَـثَةً</p><p>(And you (all) will be in three groups.) This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection. Some will on the right of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise. Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,</p><p>فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(So those on the right -- how will be those on the right! And those on the left -- how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.) Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds.)(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost.) is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p><p>وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ</p><p>(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,</p><p>سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ</p><p>(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</p>"

5076,"<h2>Which was revealed in Madina</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Hadid</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Irbad bin Sariyah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite Al-Musabbihat before he went to sleep, saying,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِيهِنَّ آيَةً أَفْضَلُ مِنْ أَلْفِ آيَة»</p><p>(In them there is an Ayah that is better than a thousand Ayat.) Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith; At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Gharib."" The Ayah referred to in this Hadith is -- and Allah knows best --</p><p>هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin. And He is the All-Knower of everything.)(57:3) Allah willing, we will again mention this subject. Upon Allah we trust and our total reliance and dependence are on Him, and sufficient He is to us as Supporter and Helper.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Everything that exists glorifies Allah and mentioning some of His Attributes</h2><p>In this Ayah, Allah states that everything that exists in the heavens and earth praises and glorifies Him, including creatures and plants. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا</p><p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.)(17:44) And His saying:</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(and He is the Almighty,) meaning the One to Whom all things submit humility,</p><p>الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(All-Wise.) in His creating, commanding and legislating,</p><p>لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ</p><p>(His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. It is He Who gives life and causes death;) He is the absolute Owner of His creation, bringing life and death and granting what He wills to whom He wills,</p><p>وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(and He is Able to do all things.) whatever He wills, is, and whatever He does not will, will never be. He said,</p><p>هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ</p><p>(He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin.) This is the Ayah indicated in the Hadith of `Irbad bin Sariyah that is better than a thousand Ayat. Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Zamil said, ""I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas that I felt something in my heart. He said, `Doubts' and then laughed. Next, he said, `No one can escape this. Allah the Exalted stated,</p><p>فَإِن كُنتَ فِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(So if you are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who are reading the Book before you. Verily, the truth has come to you from your Lord.)(10:94)' He then said to me, `When you feel any of this in your heart, recite,</p><p>هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin. And He is the All-Knower of everything.)""' There are about ten and some odd number of different sayings collected from the scholars of Tafsir regarding the explanation of this Ayah. Al-Bukhari said, ""Yahya said, `Az-Zahir: knowing all things, Al-Batin: knowing all things.""' Our Shaykh Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi said, ""Yahya is Ibn Ziyad Al-Farra', who authored a book entitled Ma`ani Al-Qur'an."" There are Hadiths mentioned about this. Among them, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite this supplication while going to bed,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّموَاتِ السَّبْعِ، وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ، رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، مُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ، فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى، لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ، أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ لَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْاخِرُ لَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُ لَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ لَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَيْءٌ. اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ، وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْر»</p><p>(O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Magnificent Throne! Our Lord, and the Lord of everything, Revealer of the Tawrah, the Injil and the Furqan, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the date stone! I seek refuge with You from the evil of everything whose forhead You have control over. O Allah! You are Al-Awwal, nothing is before You; Al-Akhir, nothing is after You; Az-Zahir, nothing is above You; and Al-Batin, nothing is below You. Remove the burden of debt from us and free us from poverty.) Muslim recorded this Hadith via Sahl, who said, ""Abu Salih used to order us to lay on our right side when we were about to sleep, and then say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّموَاتِ وَرَبَّ الْأَرْضِ وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ، رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى، وَمُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ ذِي شَرَ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ، اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْاخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُ فَلَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ فَلَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَيْءٌ، اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ، وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْر»</p><p>(O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Magnificent Throne!

5079,"<h2>Allah's Knowledge, Power and Kingdom are Limitless</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that He created the heavens and earth, and all that is between them, in six Days and then rose over the Throne after He created them. We discussed this before in the explanation of Surat Al-A`raf, so it is not necessary to repeat the meaning here. Allah's statement,</p><p>يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلْجُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(He knows what goes into the earth), indicates His knowledge in the amount of seeds and drops of water that enter inside the earth's surface,</p><p>وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا</p><p>(and what comes forth from it) of plants, vegetation and fruits. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And with Him are the keys of all that is hidden, none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.)(6:59) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ</p><p>(and what descends from the heaven), pertains to rain, snow, hail and whatever Allah decides descends from heaven of decisions and commandments brought down by the honorable angels. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا</p><p>(and what ascends thereto.), refers to angels and deeds. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Prophet said,</p><p>«يُرْفَعُ إِلَيْهِ عَمَلُ اللَّيْلِ قَبْلَ النَّهَارِ، وَعَمَلُ النَّهَارِ قَبْلَ اللَّيْل»</p><p>(To Him ascend the deeds of the night before the day falls and the deeds of the day before the night falls.) Allah said,</p><p>وَهُوَ مَعَكُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>(And He is with you wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.) meaning, He is watching over you and witnessing your deeds wherever you may be, on land or at sea, during the night or the day, at home or in open areas or deserts. All of that is the same before His knowledge and all of it is under His sight and hearing. He hears your speech and sees where you are. He knows your secrets and your public statements,</p><p>أَلا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ لِيَسْتَخْفُواْ مِنْهُ أَلا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p><p>(No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All-Knower of the (secrets) of the breasts. )(11:5) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ</p><p>(It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.)(13:10) Surely, there is no deity worthy of worship, except Allah. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ answered Jibril, when he asked him about Ihsan:</p><p>«أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك»</p><p>(To worship Allah as if you see Him, and even though you cannot see Him, He surely sees you.) Allah's statement,</p><p>لَّهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الاٍّمُورُ</p><p>(His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allh return all the matters.) asserts that Allah is the King and Owner of this life and the Hereafter. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِنَّ لَنَا لَلاٌّخِرَةَ وَالاٍّولَى</p><p>(And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).)(92:13) Surely, Allah is praised for this attribute, just as He said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى الاٍّولَى وَالاٌّخِرَةِ</p><p>(And He is Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, all praise is His in the first and in the last.)(28:70), and,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْخَبِيرُ</p><p>(All the praise is Allah's, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. His is all the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.)(34:1) Allah owns everything that is in the heavens and earth, and all their inhabitants are servants to Him and humble before Him, just as He said,</p><p>إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً</p><p>(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:93-95) This is why Allah said here,</p><p>وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الأُمُورُ</p><p>(And to Allah return all the matters.) meaning that all matters will be referred to Him on the Day of Resurrection and He will judge His creation as He wills. Indeed, He is the Most Just, Who never falls into injustice, not even the weight of a speck of dust; if one performs even one good deed, Allah will multiply it up to ten times,</p><p>وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(and gives from Him a great reward. )(4:40),</p><p>وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَزِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَى بِنَا حَـسِبِينَ</p><p>(And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And sufficent are We to take account.)(21:47) Allah's statement,</p><p>يُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى النَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ</p><p>(He merges night into day, and merges day into night,) meaning, He does what He wills with His creatures. He alternates the night and day and measures them by His wisdom, as He wills. Sometimes, He makes the night longer than the day, and sometimes the opposite. Sometimes, He makes the length of night and day equal. Sometimes, He makes the season winter, then changes it to spring, then summer then autumn. All this He does by His wisdom and His due measure of everything in His creation,</p><p>وَهُوَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p><p>(and He has full knowledge of whatsoever is in the breasts.) He knows the secrets, no matter how concealed they are.</p>"

5082,"<h2>Ordering Faith and encouraging spending</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Blessed orders having perfect faith in Him and in His Messenger, and that one should persist on this path adhereing firmly to it. Allah encourages spending from what He has made mankind trustees of, the wealth that you - mankind - have, that He has lent you. This wealth was in the hands of those before you and was later transferred to you. Therefore, O mankind, spend as Allah commanded you from the wealth that He entrusted to you for His obedience. Otherwise, He will hold you accountable and punish you for your ignoring what He ordained on you in this regard. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ</p><p>(of that whereof He has made you trustees.), indicates that you - mankind -- will surrender this wealth to someone else. In this case, those who will inherit from you might obey Allah with their wealth, and thus acquire more happiness than you on account of what Allah has granted them. They might disobey Allah, and in this case you will have helped them commit evil and transgression. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, ""I came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ as he was reciting and saying,</p><p>أَلْهَـكُمُ التَّكَّاثُرُ</p><p>يَقُولُ ابْنُ آدَمَ: مَالِي مَالِي، وَهَلْ لَكَ مِن مَالِكَ إِلَّا مَاأَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ، أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ، أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ؟»</p><p>((abundance diverts you.)( The Son of `Adam claims, ""My wealth, my wealth."" But is there anything belonging to you, except that which you consumed, which you used, or which you wore and then it became worn or you gave as charity and sent it forward) Muslim also collected with the addition:</p><p>«وَمَا سِوَى ذلِكَ، فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»</p><p>(Other than that, you will go away from it and leave it behind for other people.) Allah's statement,</p><p>فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُواْ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And such of you as believe and spend, theirs will be a great reward.) encourages having faith and spending in acts of obedience. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord;) meaning, ""what prevents you from believing, while the Messenger is among you calling you to faith and bringing forward clear proofs and evidences that affirm the truth of what he brought you"" And we have reported the Hadith through different routes in the beginning of the explanation on the chapter on Faith in Sahih Al-Bukhari, wherein one day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«أَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعْجَبُ إِلَيْكُمْ إِيمَانًا؟»</p><p>(Who do you consider among the believers as having the most amazing faith) They said, ""The angels."" He said,</p><p>«وَمَا لَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»</p><p>(And what prevents them from believing when they are with their Lord) They said, ""Then the Prophets."" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْوَحْيُ يَنْزِلُ عَلَيْهِمْ؟»</p><p>(What prevents them from believing when the revelation comes down to them) They said, ""Then us."" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَكُمْ لَا تُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ؟ وَلكِنْ أَعْجَبُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِيمَانًا، قَوْمٌ يَجِيئُونَ بَعْدَكُمْ، يَجِدُونَ صُحُفًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(What prevents you from believing, when I am amongst you Actually, the believers who have the most amazing faith, are some people who will come after you; they will find pages that they will believe in.) We mentioned a part of this Hadith when explaining Allah's statement in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(who believe in the Ghayb (unseen).)(2:3) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَـقَكُمْ</p><p>(and He has indeed taken your covenant,) is similar to another of His statements,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَـقَهُ الَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor to you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said: ""We hear and we obey."")(5:7), which refers to giving the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir said that the covenant mentioned here, is that taken from mankind, when they were still in Adam's loin. This is also the opinion of Mujahid, and Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</p><p>(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant) clear proofs, unequivocal evidences and plain attestations,</p><p>لِيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p>(that He may bring you out from darkness into light.) from the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and contradictory statements to the light of guidance, certainty and faith,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) by revealing the Divine Books and sending the Messengers to guide mankind, eradicating doubts and removing confusion. After Allah commanded mankind to first believe and spend, He again encouraged them to acquire faith and stated that He has removed all barriers between them and the acquisition of faith. Allah again encouraged them to spend,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلاَّ تُنفِقُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَاثُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.) means, spend and do not fear poverty or scarcity. Surely, He in Whose cause you spent is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and has perfect control over their every affair, including their treasuries. He is the Owner of the Throne, with all the might that it contains, and He is the One Who said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers.)(34:39), and,</p><p>مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ</p><p>(whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain.)(16:96) Therefore, those who trust in and depend on Allah will spend, and they will not fear poverty or destitution coming to them from the Owner of the Throne. They know that Allah will surely compensate them for whatever they spend.</p><h2>The Virtues of spending and fighting before the Conquest of Makkah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى مِنكُم مَّنْ أَنفَقَ مِن قَبْلِ الْفَتْحِ وَقَـتَلَ</p><p>(Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquering and fought.) meaning those who did not fight and spend before the Conquest are not equal to those who spent and fought. Before Makkah was conquered, things were difficult for Muslims and only the righteous ones embraced Islam. After Makkah was conquered, Islam spread tremendously throughout the known world and people embraced the religion of Allah en masse. Similarly He said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ أَنفَقُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَقَـتَلُواْ وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) The majority considers the Conquest here to be the conquest of Makkah. Ash-Sha`bi and several others said that the Ayah refers to the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah. There is proof for this opinion found in a Hadith from Anas, collected by Imam Ahmad. Anas said, ""Khalid bin Al-Walid and `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf had a dispute. Khalid said to `Abdur-Rahman, `You boast about days (battles) that you participated in before us.' When the news of this statement reached the Prophet he said,</p><p>«دَعُوا لِي أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ أَوْ مِثْلَ الْجِبَالِ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغْتُمْ أَعْمَالَهُم»</p><p>(Do not bother my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If you spend an amount of gold equal to (Mount) Uhud, (or equal to the mountains), you will not reach the level of their actions.)"" It is a known fact that Khalid bin Al-Walid, whom the Prophet addressed this statement to, embraced Islam during the period between the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the conquering of Makkah. The dispute between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman occurred because of the battle of Bani Jadhimah. The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to them after the conquest of Makkah, and they said, ""Saba'na,"" instead of saying, ""Aslamna"" (we embraced Islam). So Khalid ordered their execution and the execution of their prisoners (of war); `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf and `Abdullah bin `Umar opposed him. This is the reason behind the dispute that occurred between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman. But in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَا نَصِيفَه»</p><p>(None should revile my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend as much gold as Uhud, it would not reach the level of them equal to an amount as much as one Mudd of one of them or half of it.) Allah said,</p><p>وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) meaning, those who spent before and after the conquest of Makkah; they all will gain a reward for their good deeds, even though some of them vary in rank and earn a better reward than others as Allah said,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْقَـعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِى الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred by a great reward those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home).)(4:95) There is a Hadith in the Sahih that states,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ، وَفِي كُلَ خَيْر»</p><p>(The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer; both have goodness in them.) The Prophet ended his statement this way to draw attention to the second type of believer, so that their own qualities are not forgotten in the midst of preferring the former type. In this way, the latter is not dismissed as being degraded in the Hadith. Therefore, the Prophet ended his statement by praising the second type -- the weak believers -- after giving preference to the first type. Allah said:</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, since Allah is perfectly aware of all things, He made distinctions between the rewards of the believers who spent and fought before the Conquest and those who spent and fought afterwards. Surely, Allah does this by His knowledge of the intention of the former type and their perfect sincerity to Him, all the while spending in times of hardship, poverty and dire straits. This is found in the Hadith,</p><p>«سَبَقَ دِرْهَمٌ مِائَةَ أَلْف»</p><p>(Spending one Dirham is preceded over a hundred thousand.) There is no doubt that the people of faith consider Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to be the person who has the best share according to the meaning of this Ayah. He was the chief of those who implemented it, among all followers of all Prophets. He spent all of his wealth seeking the Face of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He did it voluntarily too, not to repay a debt or a favor that anyone from mankind had on him. May Allah be pleased with him.</p><h2>The Encouragement to make a Handsome Loan in the Cause of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan:) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that this Ayah refers to spending in Allah's cause. It was also said that it pertains to spending on children. What is correct is that it is more general than that. So all those who spend in the cause of Allah with good intentions and a sincere heart, then they fall under the generality of this Ayah. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) and in another Ayah,</p><p>أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</p><p>(many times) (2:245), meaning, being handsome reward and tremendous provisions: Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""When this Ayah,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) was revealed, Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `O Allah's Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.) He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah's Messenger,' and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand. Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.' He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too. Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!' She said, `Here I am.' He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)"" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</p>"

""The woman who disputed"" came to the Prophet and argued with him while I was in another part of the room, unable to hear what she said. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,</p><p>قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا</p><p>(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband.)"" till the end of this Ayah. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith without a chain of narration in the Book of Tawhid in his Sahih. An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir also collected this Hadith. In the narration that Ibn Abi Hatim collected, `A'ishah said, ""Blessed is He, Whose hearing has encompassed all things. I heard what Khawlah bint Tha`labah said while some of it I could not hear. She was complaining to Allah's Messenger ﷺ about her husband. She said, `O Allah's Messenger! He spent my wealth, exhausted my youth and my womb bore abundantly for him. When I be- came old, unable to bear children, he pronounced the Ziharon me! O Allah! I complain to you.' Soon after, Jibril brought down this Ayah,</p><p>قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا</p><p>(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband,)"" She added, ""Her husband was Aws bin As-Samit.""</p>"
5106,"<h2>Az-Zihar and the Atonement for It Imam</h2><p>Ahmad recorded that Khuwaylah bint Tha`labah said, ""By Allah! Allah sent down the beginning of Surat Al-Mujadilah in connection with me and `Aws bin As-Samit. He was my husband and had grown old and difficult. One day, he came to me and I argued with him about something and he said, out of anger, `You are like my mother's back to me.' He went out and sat with some of his people. Then he came back and wanted to have sexual intercourse with me. I said, `No, by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Khuwaylah! You will not have your way with me after you said what you said, until Allah and His Messenger issue judgement about our case.' He wanted to have his way regardless of my choice and I pushed him away from me; he was an old man.' I next went to one of my neighbors and borrowed a garment from her and went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. I told him what happened and kept complaining to him of the ill treatment I received from `Aws. He said,</p><p>«يَاخُوَيْلَةُ، ابْنُ عَمِّكِ شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ، فَاتَّقِي اللهَ فِيه»</p><p>(O Khuwaylah! Your cousin is an old man, so have Taqwa of Allah regarding him.) By Allah! Before I departed, parts of the Qur'an were revealed about me. Allah's Messenger ﷺ felt the hardship upon receiving the revelation as he usually did and then became relieved. He said to me,</p><p>«يَا خُوَيْلَةُ، قَدْ أَنْزَلَ اللهُ فِيكِ وَفِي صَاحِبِكِ قُرْآنًا»</p><p>(O Khuwaylah! Allah has revealed something about you and your spouse.) He recited to me,</p><p>قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِى إِلَى اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمآ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband, and complains to Allah. And Allah hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.), until,</p><p>وَلِلكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment.) He then said to me,</p><p>«مُرِيهِ فَلْيُعْتِقْ رَقَبَة»</p><p>(Command him to free a slave.) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! He does not have any to free.' He said,</p><p>«فَلْيَصُمْ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْن»</p><p>(Let him fast for two consecutive months.) I said, `By Allah! He is an old man and cannot fast.' He said,</p><p>«فَلْيُطْعِمْ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِينًا وَسْقًا مِنْ تَمْر»</p><p>(Let him feed sixty poor people a Wasq of dates.) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, he does not have any of that.' He said,</p><p>«فَإِنَّا سَنُعِينُهُ بِعَرَقٍ مِنْ تَمْر»</p><p>(We will help him with a basket of dates.) I said, `And I, O Allah's Messenger! I will help him with another.' He said,</p><p>«قَدْ أَصَبْتِ وَأَحْسَنْتِ فَاذْهَبِي فَتَصَدَّقِي بِهِ عَنْهُ، ثُمَّ اسْتَوْصِي بِابْنِ عَمِّكِ خَيْرًا»</p><p>(You have done a righteously good thing. So go and give away the dates on his behalf and take care of your cousin.) I did that.""' Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith in the Book of Divorce in his Sunan, according to which her name is Khawlah bint Tha`labah. She is also known as Khawlah bint Malik bin Tha`labah, and Khuwaylah. All these are close to each other, and Allah knows best. This is what is correct about the reason behind revealing this Surah. Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُظَـهِرُونَ مِنكُمْ مِّن نِّسَآئِهِمْ</p><p>(Those among you who make their wives unlawful to them by Zihar) refers to Zihar, which is derived from Az-Zahr, meaning, the back. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when one wanted to declare Zihar towards his wife, he would say, ""To me, you are like the back of my mother."" That was one way they issued divorce during that time. Allah allowed this Ummah to pay expiation for this statement and did not render it as a divorce, contrary to the case during the time of Jahiliyyah. Allah said,</p><p>مَّا هُنَّ أُمَّهَـتِهِمْ إِنْ أُمَّهَـتُهُمْ إِلاَّ اللاَّئِى وَلَدْنَهُمْ</p><p>(they cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth.) meaning, when the husband says to his wife that she is like his mother, or the back of his mother etc., she does not become his mother. Rather his mother is she who gave birth to him. This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَقُولُونَ مُنكَراً مِّنَ الْقَوْلِ وَزُوراً</p><p>(And verily, they utter an ill word and a lie.) meaning, false and sinful speech,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.) meaning, `what you used to do during the time of Jahiliyyah, and what accidentally slips out of your mouth, unintentionally.' Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يُظَـهِرُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُواْ</p><p>(And those who make unlawful to them (their wives) by Zihar and wish to free themselves from what they uttered,) Ash-Shafi`i said, ""It means to keep her for a while after the Zihar, without divorcing her, even though his is able to do so."" Ahmad bin Hanbal said, ""To return to having sexual relations with her or to merely intend to do so, but only after he pays the expiation mentioned in the Ayah for his statement."" It has been quoted from Malik that it is the intention to have sexual relations or to keep her or actually having sexual intercourse. Sa`id bin Jubayr said that this Ayah,</p><p>ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُواْ</p><p>(and wish to free themselves from what they uttered,) meaning, if they want to return to having sexual intercourse which was forbidden between them. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it is to utilize her sexual organ, and he did not see any harm in doing what is less than that before paying the expiation. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا</p><p>(before they touch each other.) ""The `touching' refers here to sexual intercourse."" Similar was said by `Ata', Az-Zuhri, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan. Az-Zuhri added, ""He is not to kiss or touch her until he pays the expiation."" The Sunan compilers recorded from `Ikrimah, from Ibn `Abbas that a man said, ""O Allah's Messenger! I pronounced Zihar on my wife, but then had sexual intercourse with her before I paid the expiation."" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا حَمَلَكَ عَلى ذَلِكَ يَرْحَمُكَ الله»</p><p>(May Allah grant you His mercy, what made you do that) He said, ""I saw the adornment she was wearing shining in the moon's light."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«فَلَا تَقْرَبْهَا حَتْى تَفْعَلَ مَا أَمَرَكَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p><p>(Then do not touch her until you do what Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has ordered you to do.) At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Gharib Sahih."" Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. Allah said,</p><p>فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ</p><p>((the penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave) indicating the necessity of freeing a slave before they touch each other. This Ayah mentions any slave, not only believing servants as in the case of the expiation for (unintentional) killing,</p><p>ذَلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِ</p><p>(That is an admonition to you.) meaning, a warning to threaten you in this case.</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, He is All-Knower in what brings you benefit. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا فَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعَامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِيناً</p><p>(And he who finds not must fast two successive months before they both touch each other. And he who is unable to do so, should feed sixty of the poor.) is explained by the Hadiths that prescribe these punishments in this order, just as in the Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs about the man who had sexual intercourse with his wife during the day, in Ramadan. Allah said,</p><p>ذَلِكَ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(That is in order that you may have perfect faith in Allah and His Messenger.) meaning, `We legislated this punishment so that you acquire this trait,'</p><p>وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ</p><p>(These are the limits set by Allah.) meaning, the things that He has forbidden, so do not transgress them,</p><p>وَلِلكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment.) meaning, those who do not believe and do not abide by the rulings of Islamic legislation should never think they will be saved from the torment. Rather theirs will be a painful torment in this life and the Hereafter.</p>"

5112,"<h2>The Evil of the Jews</h2><p>Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نُهُواْ عَنِ النَّجْوَى ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ</p><p>(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden,) He said, ""The Jews."" Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, ""The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet's Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نُهُواْ عَنِ النَّجْوَى ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ</p><p>(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden)."" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَيَتَنَـجَوْنَ بِالإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ الرَّسُولِ</p><p>(and conspired together for sin and wrongdoing and disobedience to the Messenger.) means, they used to talk to each other,</p><p>بِالإِثْمِ</p><p>(for sin) which involves themselves,</p><p>وَالْعُدْوَنِ</p><p>(and wrongdoing) which effects others. They speak about disobedience and defying of the Messenger , with persistence and recommending each other to follow their way,</p><p>وَإِذَا جَآءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A'ishah said, ""Some Jews came to the Prophet and greeted him by saying, `As-Sam `Alayka, O Abul-Qasim.' So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).' The Prophet said,</p><p>«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفُحْشَ وَلَا التَّفَحُّش»</p><p>(O `A'ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech.)

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to her,</p><p>«إِنَّهُ يُسْتَجَابُ لَنَا فِيهِمْ، وَلَا يُسْتَجَابُ لَهُمْ فِينَا»</p><p>(Allah accepts our supplication against them, but not theirs against us.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, ""A Jew passed by Allah's Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah's Messenger ﷺ then said to his Companions,</p><p>«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَا قَالَ؟»</p><p>(Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah's Messenger.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«بَلْ قَالَ: سَامٌ عَلَيْكُم»</p><p>(Rather he said, Sam `Alaykum.) meaning, `may you disgrace your religion.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ then said,</p><p>«رُدُّوه»</p><p>(Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«أَقُلْتَ: سَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ؟»</p><p>(Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.' The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِذَا سَلَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ أَحَدٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ فَقُولُوا: عَلَيْك»</p><p>(When the people of the Book greet you, say, `Wa `Alaykum.')"" meaning, `and the same on you too.' The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A'ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلاَ يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ</p><p>(and say within themselves:""Why should Allah punish us not for what we say"") means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad ﷺ were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.' Allah the Exalted replied,</p><p>حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ</p><p>(Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,</p><p>يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p>(they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, ""Sam `Alayka,"" to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. They would say then within themselves, ""Why does Allah not punish us for what we say"" This Ayah was later revealed,</p><p>وَإِذَا جَآءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ وَيَقُولُونَ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلاَ يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p>(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: ""Why should Allah punish us not for what we say"" Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it.</p><h2>Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</h2><p>Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا تَنَاجَيْتُمْ فَلاَ تَتَنَـجَوْاْ بِالإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَةِ الرَّسُولِ</p><p>(O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,</p><p>وَتَنَـجَوْاْ بِالْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ الَّذِى إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ</p><p>(but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>إِنَّمَا النَّجْوَى مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ لِيَحْزُنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَلَيْسَ بِضَآرِّهِمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are</p><p>مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ لِيَحْزُنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</p><p>(only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,</p><p>لِيَحْزُنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</p><p>(in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا كُنْتُمْ ثَلَاثَةً فَلَا يَتَنَاجَى اثْنَانِ دُونَ صَاحِبِهِمَا، فَإِنَّ ذلِكَ يُحْزِنُه»</p><p>(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا كُنْتُمْ ثَلَاثَةً فَلَا يَتَنَاجَى اثْنَانِ دُونَ الثَّالِثِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ، فَإِنَّ ذلِكَ يُحْزِنُه»</p><p>(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>"

5127,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas used to call this chapter, `Surah Bani An-Nadir.' Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, ""I asked Ibn `Abbas about Surat Al-Hashr and he said, `It was revealed about Bani An-Nadir.""' Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded it using another chain of narration from Ibn `Abbas. Al-Bukhari also recorded it from Abu `Awanah, from Abu Bishr from Sa`id bin Jubayr, who said, ""I asked Ibn `Abbas, `Surat Al-Hashr' He said, `Surah Bani An-Nadir.""'</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Everything glorifies Allah in its own Way</h2><p>Allah states that everything that exists in the heavens and on the earth praises, glorifies, reveres and prays to Him and affirms His Oneness. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ</p><p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification.)(17:44) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(And He is the Almighty) meaning of invincible majesty,</p><p>الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(the All-Wise.) in what He decrees and legislates.</p><h2>The End that Bani An-Nadir suffered</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَخْرَجَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani An-Nadir, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and several others. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Al-Madinah, he made a peace treaty with the Jews stipulating that he would not fight them and they would not fight him. They soon betrayed the treaty that they made with Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Therefore, Allah sent His torment down on them; it can never be averted, and His appointed destiny touched them; it can never be resisted. The Prophet forced them to evacuate and abandon their fortified forts that Muslims did not think they would ever control. The Jews thought that their fortifications will save them from Allah's torment, but they did not help them against Allah in the least. Then, that which they did not expect came to them from Allah, and Allah's Messenger ﷺ forced them to leave Al-Madinah. Some of them went to Adhri`at in the area of Ash-Sham, which is the area of the grand Gathering and Resurrection, while others went to Khaybar. The Prophet allowed them to evacuate their forts and take whatever their camels could carry. They destroyed the property that they could not carry. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَاعْتَبِرُواْ يأُوْلِى الاٌّبْصَـرِ</p><p>(they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers Then take admonition, O you with eyes.) meaning, ""Contemplate the end of those who defied Allah's command, contradicted His Messenger and denied His Book. See how Allah's humiliating torment struck them in this life, as well as, the painful torment that Allah has reserved for them in the Hereafter."" Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Ka`b bin Malik said that one of the Prophet's Companions said, ""The Quraysh idolators wrote to `Abdullah bin Ubayy and those who were still worshipping idols among the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was in Al-Madinah at the time, before the battle of Badr occurred. They wrote: `You have given refuge to our citizen. We swear by Allah, you should fight him, or we will expel you or gather all our forces, until we kill your soldiers and take your women captive.' When the news of this threat reached `Abdullah bin Ubayy and the idolators of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, they prepared to fight the Prophet . The news of this reached the Prophet and he went to them saying,</p><p>«لَقَدْ بَلَغَ وَعِيدُ قُرَيْشٍ مِنْكُمُ الْمَبَالِغَ، مَا كَانَتْ تَكِيدُكُمْ بِأَكْثَرَ مِمَّا تُرِيدُ أَن تَكِيدُوا بِهِ أَنْفُسَكُمْ، تُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تُقَاتِلُوا أَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَإِخْوَانَكُم»</p><p>(The threat of the Quraysh has caused you extreme anxiety! The Quraysh cannot cause you more harm than what you will cause yourselves by your actions. Do you want to fight your children and brethren) When they heard these words from the Prophet , they dis- persed and the news of what happened reached the Quraysh idolators. After the battle of Badr, the Quraysh idolators wrote to the Jews of Al-Madinah, `You have armor and forts! You should fight our citizen or we will do such and such to you, and nothing will prevent us from acquiring your women.'The news of this letter also reached the Prophet and Bani An-Nadir intended to betray their treaty. Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Prophet asking him to come with thirty of his Companions to meet thirty of their rabbis half way, from either side. They said that the rabbis would listen to the Prophet and if they believe in him, the rest of Bani An-Nadir would believe. They intended to kill the Messenger , and Allah informed His Messenger of this plot before they could harm him. The next day, the Prophet gathered his forces and laid siege to their area, saying to them,</p><p>«إِنَّكُمْ وَاللهِ لَا تَأْمَنُونَ عِنْدِي إِلَّا بِعَهْدٍ تُعَاهِدُونَنِي عَلَيْه»</p><p>(By Allah ! You will not be safe until and unless you renew your peace treaty with me.) They refused to do so, and the Prophet fought them the rest of that day. The next morning, the Prophet laid siege to the tribe of Bani Qurayzah and left Bani An-Nadir alone that day. The Prophet ordered Bani Qurayzah to sign a new treaty of peace, and they accepted. The Prophet left Bani Qurayzah and went back to Bani An-Nadir with his forces and fought them until they agreed to surrender in return for safe passage out of Al-Madinah. Bani An-Nadir evacuated Al-Madinah and took with them all whatever their camels could carry from their furniture, including even the wood and the doors to their houses. The date trees of Bani An-Nadir were granted to the Messenger by Allah when He said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ</p><p>(And what Allah gave as booty to His Messenger from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry) that is, what you earned without a fight. The Prophet divided most of their trees between the emigrants and gave to only two men who were poor from Al-Ansar. He did not give the Ansar any of it, except for these two men. The Prophet kept a part of the war booty for himself and that part of charity of the Prophet was transferred to the administration of his daughter's children, i.e., children of Fatimah."" However, let us summarize the battle of Bani An-Nadir here. From Allah alone we seek help.</p><h2>The Reason behind the Battle of Bani An-Nadir</h2><p>After the seventy Companions whom the Prophet sent to teach the Qur'an were killed at the area of Bi'r Ma`unah, excluding `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri, who killed two men from the tribe of Bani `Amir on his way back to Al-Madinah. He did not know that these two men had a promise of safe passage from Allah's Messenger ﷺ. When he went back to Al-Madinah, he told the Prophet what happened and the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَقَدْ قَتَلْتَ رَجُلَيْنِ لَأَدِيَنَّهُمَا»</p><p>(You have killed two men, I shall pay the blood money for them.) Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir were allies and had treaties. The Prophet asked Bani An-Nadir to help pay the blood money for the two dead men. The area of Bani An-Nadir was in a suburb of Al-Madinah, a few miles to the east. In his book of Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said; ""Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went to Bani An-Nadir to ask them for financial help to pay the blood money of the two men from Bani `Amir, who were killed by `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri. They had a promise of safe passage from the Prophet according to the (subnarrator) Yazid bin Ruman. Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir had a treaty and were allies. When Allah's Messenger ﷺ went to Bani An-Nadir asking them for help to pay the blood money for the two men, they said, `Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim! We will help you, since you asked us for help.' Yet, when they met each other in secret, they said, `You will not find a better chance with this man than this,' while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting next to a wall of one of their houses. They said, `Who will ascend this wall and drop a stone on this man and rid us of his trouble' `Amr bin Jihash bin Ka`b volunteered and ascended the wall of the house to drop a stone on the Messenger . The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting with several of his Companions, such as Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Ali. The news of this plot was conveyed to the Prophet from heaven, and he stood up and went back to Al-Madinah. When the Companions thought that the Messenger was absent for a long time, they went to see where he was and saw a man coming from Al-Madinah. They asked him, and he said that he saw the Prophet enter Al-Madinah. The Messenger's Companions went to him, and he told them the news of the betraying plot that the Jews planned against him. He ordered them to prepare for war and to march forth to Bani An-Nadir. The Prophet gathered his forces and marched to the area of Bani An-Nadir, who had taken refuge in their fortified forts. The Messenger ﷺ ordered their date trees be cut down and burned. The Jews heralded at the Prophet, `O Muhammad! You used to forbid mischief in the earth and blame those who did it. Why is it that you had the date trees cut down and burned' Meanwhile, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, Wadi`ah, Malik bin Abi Qawqal, Suwayd, Da`is and several other men who all belonged to the tribe of Al-Khazraj bin Bani `Awf, sent a message to Bani An-Nadir saying, `Be firm and strong. We will never abandon you. If you are fought against, we will fight along with you and if you are forced to leave Al-Madinah, we will accompany you.' The Jews waited for this claim of support, but the hypocrites did not deliver. Allah cast terror in the hearts of the Jews. They asked the Messenger to allow them safe passage out of Al-Madinah and to spare their lives. In return, they would only take what their camels could carry, except for weapons. The Prophet agreed. The Jews collected all the wealth their camels could transport. One of the Jews would demolish his own house around its door, so that he could carry the door on the back of his camel. Bani An-Nadir moved to Khaybar, and some of them went to Ash-Sham. They left all that remained behind for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who had control over how it was to be divided. The Prophet divided it between the emigrants and none of Al-Ansar got a share, except for Sahl bin Hunayf and Abu Dujanah Simak bin Kharashah. They said that they were poor and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave them their share. Only two men from Bani An-Nadir embraced Islam, Yamin bin Umayr bin Ka`b bin `Amr bin Jihash and Abu Sa`d bin Wahb and they saved their wealth due to their acceptance of Islam."" Ibn Ishaq continued, ""Some of the offspring of Yamin narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Yamin,</p><p>«أَلَمْ تَرَ مَا لَقِيتُ مِنَ ابْنِ عَمِّكَ وَمَا هَمَّ بِهِ مِنْ شَأْنِي؟»</p><p>(Have you not heard what your cousin plotted to do against me) Yamin bin `Umayr promised someone a reward if he killed his cousin `Amr bin Jihash, and someone killed him, according to their claim"" Ibn Ishaq then said, ""All of Surat Al-Hashr was revealed about Bani An-Nadir. "" A similar story was recorded by Yunus bin Bukayr from Ibn Ishaq. Allah's statement,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَخْرَجَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) refers to Bani An-Nadir,</p><p>مِن دِيَـرِهِمْ لاًّوَّلِ الْحَشْرِ</p><p>(from their homes at the first gathering.) Allah said,</p><p>مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ</p><p>(You did not think that they would get out.) i.e., within the few days you laid siege against them. The Companions had surrounded their forts for only six days, and their forts were fortified and formidable. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ فَأَتَـهُمُ اللَّهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ</p><p>(And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah reached them from a place where they expected it not.) meaning, there came to them from Allah what they did not expect or anticipate. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>قَدْ مَكَرَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَى اللَّهُ بُنْيَـنَهُمْ مِّنَ الْقَوَاعِدِ فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّقْفُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَأَتَـهُمُ الْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.)(16:26) Allah said,</p><p>وَقَذَفَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الرُّعْبَ</p><p>(and He cast terror into their hearts) means, Allah cast fear, terror and fright in their hearts, and why would that not happen to them He who was given victory, by Allah frightening his enemies the distance of a month, laid siege to them. May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Prophet. As in Ibn Ishaq's explanation -- which preceded;</p><p>يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(that they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers.) the Jews brought down what they wanted to transport from their roofs and doors, so that they could carry them on camels. Similar was said by `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and several others. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن كَتَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْجَلاَءَ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ فِى الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world;) meaning, if it was not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that they would evacuate Al-Madinah, leaving behind their homes and wealth, He would have sent another type of punishment upon them, such as being killed and captured. This was said by Az-Zuhri. `Urwah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said that Allah decreed that the Jews would be punished in the life of this world and face the torment of the fire of Hell He prepared for them in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p><p>وَلَهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ عَذَابُ النَّارِ</p><p>(and in the Hereafter theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.) meaning, it is a matter ordained that they will surely face,</p><p>ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّواْ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ</p><p>(That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger.) means, Allah prepared this specific punishment and sent His Messenger and his Companions against them, because they defied Allah and His Messenger and denied the good news that Allah sent forth in the Books of previous Messengers regarding the coming of Muhammad ﷺ. The Jews knew these facts about Muhammad ﷺ just as they knew their own children. Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يُشَآقِّ اللَّهَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</p><p>(And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.)</p><h2>The Prophet Cut down the Date Trees of the Jews by the Leave of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) Linah is an especially good type of date tree. Abu `Ubaydah said that Linah is a different kind of dates than `Ajwah and Barni. Several others said that Linah refers to every type of date fruits, except for the `Ajwah (ripen dates), while Ibn Jarir said that it refers to all kinds of date trees. Ibn Jarir quoted Mujahid saying that it also includes the Buwayrah type. When the Messenger of Allah laid siege to Bani An-Nadir, to humiliate them and bring fear and terror to their hearts, he ordered their date trees to be cut down. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Yazid bin Ruman, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, ""Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Messenger , saying that he used to outlaw mischief in the earth, so why did he order that their trees be cut down Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever Linah was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them."" Mujahid said, ""Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur'an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah's leave."" There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning. An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) ""They forced them to come down from their forts and were ordered to cut their trees cut down. So the Muslims hesitated, and some of them said, `We cut down some and left some. We must ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ if we will earn a reward for what we cut and if we will be burdened for what we left intact.' Allah sent down this Ayah, t</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah)."" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered that the date trees of Bani An-Nadir be cut down and burned. The Two Sahihs collected a similar narration. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said,""Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah fought (against the Prophet ), and the Prophet exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Qurayzah to remain in their area until later, when the Prophet fought against Qurayzah. Their men were executed and their women, children and wealth were confiscated and divided among Muslims. Some of them, however, were saved because they returned to the Prophet's side, who granted them asylum, and they embraced Islam. All of the Jews of Al-Madinah, Bani Qaynuqa`, the tribe of `Abdullah bin Salam, Bani Harithah and the rest of the Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah were exiled."" The Two Sahihs also recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ burned down the date trees of Bani An-Nadir and had them cut down the date palms of Al-Buwayrah. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,</p><p>مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِىَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.)"" Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that the battle of Bani An-Nadir occurred after the battles of Uhud and Bi'r Ma`unah.</p>"

5132,"<h2>The Fai' and how it is spent</h2><p>Allah the Exalted explains the regulations for Fai', the booty that the Muslims acquire from the disbelievers, without fighting them or using cavalry and camelry in war against them. For instance, the booty collected from Bani An-Nadir was not acquired because of fighting them using horses and camels. The Muslims did not fight Bani An-Nadir in battle, but Allah forced them out of their forts on account of the fear that He placed in their hearts for Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Therefore, it was Fai' that Allah awarded His Messenger, with his discretion to spend it however he sees fit. Indeed, the Prophet spent the Fai' on righteous causes and for the benefit of Muslims in the areas that Allah mentioned in this Ayat,</p><p>وَمَآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(And what Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from them) meaning, from Bani An-Nadir,</p><p>فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ</p><p>(for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry.) refering to using camels,</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(But Allah gives power to His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.) mean, Allah is powerful and cannot be resisted or opposed; He is the Compeller over all things. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>مَّآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى</p><p>(What Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from the people of the townships) meaning, from all the villages and areas that are conquered in this manner; the booty collected from them falls under the same ruling as the booty acquired from Bani An-Nadir. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِى الْقُرْبَى وَالْيَتَامَى وَالْمَسَـكِينِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ</p><p>(it is for Allah, His Messenger, the kindred, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer,) until its end and the following Ayah. mentioning the ways the Fai' should be spent. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar said, ""The wealth of Bani An-Nadir was of the Fai' type that Allah awarded His Messenger and for which the Muslims did not have to use cavalry or camelry. Therefore, it was for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he used it for the needs of his family for a year at a time, and the rest was used to buy armors and weapons used in the cause of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored."" Ahmad collected the short form of this story. The Group, with the exception of Ibn Majah, collected this Hadith. Abu Dawud recorded that Malik bin `Aws said,""While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of `Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and I went along with him and entered the place where `Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and without a mattress. He said when I went in, `O Malik! Some of your people's families came to me due to their famine, and I have ordered that relief aid should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.' I said, `I wish that you ordered someone else to do it.' He said, `Take it.' Then Yarfa (the servant of `Umar) came saying, `O Commander of the faithful! May I admit `Uthman bin `Affan, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas' `Umar said, `Yes,' and they came in. After a while Yarfa came again and said, `O Commander of the faithful! May I admit Al-`Abbas and `Ali' `Umar said, `Yes.' So, they were admitted and Al-`Abbas said, `O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and this one (i.e., `Ali).' The group (being `Uthman and his companions) said, `O Chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them from each other.' I (Malik bin Aws) thought that they asked the four men to come in before them for this purpose. `Umar said, `Be patient!' He then asked the group (`Uthman and his companions), `I ask you by Allah by Whose permission the heaven and the earth exist, do you know that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة»</p><p>(Our (the Prophet's) property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity)' The group said, `He said so.' `Umar then turned to `Ali and Al-`Abbas and said, `I beseech you by Allah by Whose permission the heaven and the earth exist, do you know both that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة»</p><p>(Our (the Prophets`) property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity)' They replied, `He said so.' `Umar then said, `Allah bestowed on His Messenger a special favor unlike what he gave all other people. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَفَآءَ اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(And what Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.) Therefore, this property, the booty collected from Bani An-Nadir, was especially given to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. However, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave you, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion. Allah's Messenger ﷺ took the yearly expenses from it for himself and his family and left the rest in the Muslim Treasury.' He then asked the group, `I ask you by Allah with Whose permission the heavens and earth exist, do you know this' They replied, `Yes.' `Umar then said to `Ali and Al-`Abbas, `I ask you by Allah, with Whose permission that heavens and earth exist, do you know this' They said, `Yes.' `Umar added, `When Allah took His Prophet unto Him, Abu Bakr said: I am the successor of Allah's Messenger ﷺ! Then you both came to Abu Bakr asking for your (Al-`Abbas') share of inheritance from your nephew, and he (`Ali) asked for his wife's share from her father's inheritance. Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة»</p><p>(Our (the Prophets') property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity.)"" Allah knows that Abu Bakr was true, pious, rightly guided and a follower of what was right. So, Abu Bakr assumed the responsibility of that property. When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the successor of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and the successor of Abu Bakr. So I managed it as long as Allah allowed me to manage it. Then you both (`Ali and Al-`Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case, asking for that property. I said to you: I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish. I will do so on the condition that you will take a pledge before Allah's that you will manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to. So, both of you agreed and on that condition I handed it over to you. Now you come to me to render a different judgement over the property than the one I made before. By Allah, I will never give any decision other than what I have already given, until the Last Hour begins. If you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf.,"" They recorded this from the Hadith of Az-Zuhri. Allah said,</p><p>كَى لاَ يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ الاٌّغْنِيَآءِ مِنكُمْ</p><p>(in order that it may not become a fortune used by the rich among you.) means, `We made the expenditures for the Fai' like this, so that the wealth does not remain among the wealthy, who would spend it as they wish and desire and give none of it to the poor.'</p><h2>Ordering Obedience of the Messenger in All Commands and Prohibitions</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَاتَـكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُواْ</p><p>(And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).) meaning, `whatever the Messenger commands you, then do it and whatever he forbids you, then avoid it. Surely, He only commands righteousness and forbids evil.' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""Allah curses women who practice tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and the women who remove the hair from their eyebrows and faces and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful, whereby changing Allah's creation."" His statement reached a woman from Bani Asad called, Umm Ya`qub, who came to `Abdullah and said, ""I have come to know that you have cursed such and such"" He replied, ""Why should I not curse those whom Allah's Messenger ﷺ has cursed and who are cursed in Allah's Book!"" Umm Ya`qub said, ""I have read the whole Qur'an, but did not find in it what you say."" He said, ""Verily, if you have read the Qur'an, you have found it. Didn't you read,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَاتَـكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُواْ</p><p>(And whatsoever the Messenger gives you take it and whatsoever he forbids you, you abstain (from it).)"" She replied, ""Yes, I did."" He said, ""Verily, Allah's Messenger ﷺ forbade such things. "" ""She said, ""But I think that your wife does these things"" He said, ""Go and look at her."" She went and watched her, but could not see anything in support of her claim. She went back to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said that she did not notice anything on his wife. On that he said, ""If my wife was as you thought, I would not keep her with me."" The Two Sahihs recorded this from the Hadith of Sufyan Ath-Thawri. As well as a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِأَمْرٍ فَائْتُوا مِنْهُ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ، وَمَا نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْهُ فَاجْتَنِبُوه»</p><p>(When I order you to do something, then do as much as you can of it. If I forbid something for you, then shun it.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ آلْعِقَابِ</p><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.) means, fear Allah by obeying His orders and refraining from His prohibitions. Surely, Allah is severe in punishment for those who defy Him and reject and disobey His commands as well as, those who commit what He forbids and prohibits.</p>"

5134,"<h2>Those Who deserve the Fai'; and the Virtues of the Muhajirin and Al-Ansar</h2><p>Allah states the categories of needy people who also deserve a part of the Fai',</p><p>الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِمْ وَأَمْوَلِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَناً</p><p>(who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking bounties from Allah and (His) good pleasure,) meaning, departed their homes and defied their people, seeking the acceptance of Allah and His favor,</p><p>وَيَنصُرُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصَّـدِقُونَ</p><p>(and helping Allah and His Messenger. Such are indeed the truthful.) meaning, `they are those who were truthful in statement and deed, and they are the chiefs of the Muhajirin.' Allah the Exalted praised the Ansar next and emphasized their virtue, status and honor, preferring to give to others over themselves, even though they were in need, and not feeling enviousness. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ تَبَوَّءُوا الدَّارَ وَالإِيمَـنَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ</p><p>(And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes and had adopted the faith,) referring to those who resided in the city to which the migration occurred, before the emigrants arrived at it, and who embraced the faith before many of the emigrants. `Umar said, ""I recommend the Khalifah, who will come after me, to know the rights and virtues of the foremost Muhajirin and to preserve their honor. I also recommend him to be kind to the Ansar, those who resided in the city of Hijrah and embraced the faith beforehand, that he accepts the good that comes from those who do good among them and forgives those among them who commit errors."" Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>يُحِبُّونَ مَنْ هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(love those who emigrate to them,) indicates that they, on account of their generosity and honorable conduct, loved those who emigrated to them and comforted them with their wealth. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said, ""The Muhajirin said, `O Allah's Messenger! We have never met people like those whom we emigrated to; comforting us in times of scarcity and giving us with a good heart in times of abundance. They have sufficed for us and shared their wealth with us so much so, that we feared that they might earn the whole reward instead of us.' He said,</p><p>«لَا، مَا أَثْنَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَدَعَوْتُمُ اللهَ لَهُم»</p><p>(No they won't, as long you thanked them for what they did and invoked Allah for them.)"" I have not seen this version in the other books. Al-Bukhari recorded that Yahya bin Sa`id heard Anas bin Malik, when he went with him to Al-Walid, saying, ""The Prophet called Ansar to divide Al-Bahrayn among them. The Ansar said, `Not until you give a similar portion to our emigrant brothers.' He said,</p><p>«إِمَّا لَا، فَاصْبِرُوا حَتْى تَلْقَوْنِي، فَإِنَّهُ سَيُصِيبُكُمْ بَعْدِي أَثَرَة»</p><p>(Perhaps, no; but you will soon see people giving preference to others, so remain patient until you meet me (on the Day of Resurrection).)"" Al-Bukhari was alone with this version. He also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""The Ansar said (to the Prophet ), `Distribute our date-palms between us and our emigrant brothers.' He replied, `No.' The Ansar said (to the emigrants), `Look tend to the trees and share the fruits with us.' The emigrants said, `We hear and obey.""' Al-Bukhari, but not Muslim, recorded it.</p><h2>The Ansar never envied the Muhajirin</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ فِى صُدُورِهِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّآ أُوتُواْ</p><p>(and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given,) meaning, the Ansar did not have any envy for the Muhajirin because of the better status, rank, or more exalted grade that Allah gave the Muhajirin above them. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِّمَّآ أُوتُواْ</p><p>(that which they have been given,) refers to what the Muhajirin were favored with, according to Qatadah and Ibn Zayd.</p><h2>Selflessness of the Ansar</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ</p><p>(and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that.) meaning, they preferred giving to the needy rather than attending to their own needs, and began by giving the people before their own selves, even though they too were in need. An authentic Hadith stated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقَةِ جُهْدُ الْمُقِل»</p><p>(The best charity is that given when one is in need and struggling.) This exalted rank is better than the rank of those whom Allah described in His statements,</p><p>وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</p><p>(And they give food, inspite of their love for it.)(76:8), and,</p><p>وَءَاتَى الْمَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</p><p>(And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it.)(2:177) The latter give charity even though they love the wealth they give, not that they really need it, nor that it is necessary for them to keep it. The former prefer others to themselves even though they are in need and have a necessity for what they spend in charity. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq gave away all his wealth in charity and Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked him,</p><p>«مَا أَبْقَيْتَ لِأَهْلِكَ؟»</p><p>(What did you keep for your family,) and he said, ""I kept for them Allah and His Messenger."" `Ikrimah (bin Abi Jahl) and two other wounded fighters were offered water when they were injured during the battle of Al-Yarmuk, and each one of them said that the sip of water should be given to another of the three wounded men. They did so even though they were badly injured and craving water. When the water reached the third man, he and the other two died and none of them drank any of the water! May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased with Him. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""A man came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah's Messenger! Poverty has stuck me.' The Prophet sent a messenger to his wives (to bring something for that man to eat) but they said that they had nothing. Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَلَا رَجُلٌ يُضَيِّفُ هَذَا، اللَّيْلَةَ، رَحِمَهُ الله»</p><p>(Who will invite this person or entertain him as a guest tonight; may Allah grant His mercy to him who does so) An Ansari man said, `I, O Allah's Messenger!' So he took him to his wife and said to her, `Entertain the guest of Allah's Messenger ﷺ generously.' She said, `By Allah ! We have nothing except the meal for my children.' He said, `Let your children sleep if they ask for supper. Then turn off the lamp and we go to bed tonight while hungry.' She did what he asked her to do. In the morning the Ansari went to Allah's Messenger ﷺ who said,</p><p>«لَقَدْ عَجِبَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَوْ ضَحِكَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ وَفُلَانَة»</p><p>(Allah wondered (favorably) or laughed at the action of so-and-so and his wife.) Then Allah revealed,</p><p>وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ</p><p>(and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that). "" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in another part of his Sahih. Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. In another narration for this Hadith, the Companion's name was mentioined, it was Abu Talhah Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him. Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(And whosoever is saved from his own greed, such are they who will be the successful.) indicating that those who are saved from being stingy, then they have earned success and a good achievement. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَاتَّقُوا الشُّحَّ، فَإِنَّ الشُّحَّ أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ، حَمَلَهُمْ عَلى أَنْ سَفَكُوا دِمَاءَهُمْ وَاسْتَحَلُّوا مَحَارِمَهُم»</p><p>(Be on your guard against committing oppression, for oppression is a darkness on the Day of Resurrection. Be on your guard against being stingy, for being stingy is what destroyed those who were before you. It made them shed blood and make lawful what was unlawful for them.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Aswad bin Hilal said that a man said to `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud),""O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! I fear that I have earned destruction for myself."" `Abdullah asked him what the matter was and he said, ""I hear Allah's saying,</p><p>وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(And whosoever is saved from his own greed, such are they who will be the successful.) and I am somewhat a miser who barely gives away anything."" `Abdullah said, ""That is not the greed Allah mentioned in the Qur'an, which pertains to illegally consuming your brother's wealth. What you have is miserliness, and it is an evil thing indeed to be a miser."" Allah said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And those who came after them say: ""Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.) This is the third type of believers whose poor most deserve to receive a part of the Fai'. These three types are the Muhajirin, the Ansar and those who followed their righteous lead with excellence. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ الاٌّوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَـجِرِينَ وَالأَنْصَـرِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِىَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ</p><p>(And of the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhajirin and the Ansar and also those who followed them exactly, Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him.)(9:100) The third type are those who followed the Muhajirin and Ansar in their good works, beautiful attributes and who invoke Allah for them in public and secret. This is why Allah the Exalted said in this honorable Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ</p><p>(And those who came after them say), meaning, the statement that they utter is,</p><p>رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ</p><p>(Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred), meaning, rage or envy,</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.) Indeed, it is a beautiful way that Imam Malik used this honorable Ayah to declare that the Rafidah who curse the Companions do not have a share in the Fai' money, because they do not have the good quality of those whom Allah has described here that they say,</p><p>رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِى قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A'ishah said, ""They were commanded to invoke Allah to forgive them, but instead, they cursed them!"" She then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَنِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالإَيمَـنِ</p><p>(And those who came after them say: ""Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed."")</p>"

5151,"<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Reason behind revealing Surat Al-Mumtahanah</h2><p>The story of Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah is the reason behind revealing the beginning of this honorable Surah. Hatib was among the Early Emigrants and participated in the battle of Badr. Hatib had children and wealth in Makkah, but he was not from the tribe of Quraysh. Rather, he was an ally of `Uthman. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ decided to conquer Makkah, after its people broke the peace treaty between them, he ordered the Muslims to mobilize their forces to attack Makkah, and then said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ عَمِّ عَلَيْهِمْ خَبَرَنَا»</p><p>(O Allah! Keep our news concealed from them.) Hatib wrote a letter and sent it to the people of Makkah, with a woman from the tribe of Quraysh, informing them of the Messenger's intent to attack them. He wanted them to be indebted to him so that they would grant safety to his family in Makkah. Allah the Exalted conveyed this matter to His Messenger , because He accepted the Prophet's invocation to Him to conceal the news of the attack. The Prophet sent someone after the woman and retrieved the letter. This story is collected in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hasan bin Muhammad bin `Ali said that `Abdullah bin Abu Rafi` -- or Ubaydullah bin Abu Rafi` -- said that he heard `Ali say, ""Allah's Messenger ﷺ sent me, Zubayr and Al-Miqdad saying,</p><p>«انْطَلِقُوا حَتْى تَأْتُوا رَوْضَةَ خَاخٍ فَإِنَّ بِهَا ظَعِينَةً مَعَهَا كِتَابٌ فَخُذُوهُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Proceed until you reach Rawdat Khakh, where there is a lady carrying a letter. Take that letter from her.) So we proceeded on our way, with our horses galloping, until we reached the Rawdah. There we found the lady and said to her, `Take out the letter.' She said, `I am not carrying a letter.' We said, `Take out the letter, or else we will take off your clothes.' So she took it out of her braid, and we brought the letter to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. The letter was addressed from Hatib bin Abu Balta`ah to some pagans of Makkah, telling them about what Allah's Messenger ﷺ intended to do. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا حَاطِبُ، مَا هَذَا؟»</p><p>(O Hatib! What is this) Hatib replied, `O Allah's Messenger! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraysh, but I was an ally to them. All the Emigrants who were with you have kinsmen (in Makkah) who can protect their families. So I wanted to do them a favor, so they might protect my relatives, as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this out of disbelief or to renegade from my religion, nor did I do it to choose disbelief after Islam.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«إِنَّهُ صَدَقَكُم»</p><p>(Regarding him, he has told you the truth.) `Umar said, `O Allah's Messenger! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite!' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُ قَدْ شَهِدَ بَدْرًا، وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ اللهَ اطَّلَعَ إِلَى أَهْلِ بَدْرٍ فَقَالَ:اعْمَلُوا مَا شِئْتُمْ فَقَدْ غَفَرْتُ لَكُم»</p><p>(He attended Badr. What can I tell you, perhaps Allah looked at those who attended Badr and said, ""O the people of Badr, do what you like, for I have forgiven you."")"" The Group with the exception of Ibn Majah, collected this Hadith using various chains of narration that included Sufyan bin `Uyaynah. Al-Bukhari added in his narration in the chapter on the Prophet's battles, ""Then Allah revealed the Surah,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ عَدُوِّى وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not my enemies and your enemies as protecting friends...) "" Al-Bukhari said in another part of his Sahih, `Amr (one of the narrators of the Hadith) said, ""This Ayah,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ عَدُوِّى وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not my enemies and your enemies as protecting friends'...) was revealed about Hatib, but I do not know if the Ayah was mentioned in the Hadith (or was added as an explanation by one of the narrators)."" Al-Bukhari also said that `Ali bin Al-Madini said that Sufyan bin `Uyaynah was asked, ""Is this why this Ayah,</p><p>لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ عَدُوِّى وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not my enemies and your enemies as protecting friends.) was revealed"" Sufyan said, ""This is the narration that I collected from `Amr, I did not leave a letter out of it. I do not know if anyone else memorized the same words for it.""</p><h2>The Command to have Enmity towards the Disbelievers and to abandon supporting Them</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ عَدُوِّى وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ وَقَدْ كَفَرُواْ بِمَا جَآءَكُمْ مِّنَ الْحَقِّ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as protecting friends showing affection towards them, while they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth,) refers to the idolators and the disbelievers who are combatants against Allah, His Messenger and the believers. It is they whom Allah has decided should be our enemies and should be fought. Allah has forbidden the believers to take them as friends, supporters or companions. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah ,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَـرَى أَوْلِيَآءَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as protecting friends, they are but protecting friends of each other. And if any among you takes them (as such), then surely, he is one of them.) (5:51) This Ayah contains a stern warning and a sure threat. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُواْ دِينَكُمْ هُزُواً وَلَعِباً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَالْكُفَّارَ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not as protecting friends those who take your religion as a mockery and fun from among those who received the Scripture before you, nor from among the disbelievers; and have Taqwa of Allah if you indeed are true believers.) (5:57)</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَجْعَلُواْ للَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not for protecting friends disbelievers instead of believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a manifest proof against yourselves) (4:144) and,</p><p>لاَّ يَتَّخِذِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَىْءٍ إِلاَ أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنْهُمْ تُقَـةً وَيُحَذِّرْكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ</p><p>(Let not the believers take the disbelievers as protecting friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allah warns you against Himself (His punishment).) (3:28) This is why Allah's Messenger ﷺ accepted Hatib's excuse when he said that he only wanted to have a favor on the Quraysh, because of the property and family members he left behind in Makkah. Allah's statement,</p><p>يُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّـكُمْ</p><p>(and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves ( from your homeland)) follows His encouragement to fight against them and to avoid being their supporters. This is because they expelled the Messenger and his Companions on account of their hatred for Tawhid and worshipping Allah alone in sincerity. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَن تُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(because you believe in Allah, your Lord!) meaning, `your only fault is that you believed in Allah, Lord of all that exists.' Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَمَا نَقَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ</p><p>(And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, Almighty, Al-Hamid!) (85:8) and,</p><p>الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِم بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ إِلاَّ أَن يَقُولُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ</p><p>(Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly only because they said: ""Our Lord is Allah."") (22:40) Allah said,</p><p>إِن كُنتُمْ خَرَجْتُمْ جِهَاداً فِى سَبِيلِى وَابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِى</p><p>(If you have come forth to strive in My cause and to seek My good pleasure.) Allah says, `if you are as described here, then do not take the disbelievers as supporters. If you migrated in Jihad for My cause and for seeking My pleasure, then do not take My enemies and your enemies as protecting friends, after they expelled you from your homes and property in rage against you and rejection of your religion.' Allah's statement,</p><p>تُسِرُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ وَأَنَاْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَآ أَخْفَيْتُمْ وَمَآ أَعْلَنتُمْ</p><p>(You show friendship to them in secret, while I am All-Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal.) Allah asks, `do you do this while I know the secrets of the hearts, the intentions and all apparent things,'</p><p>وَمَن يَفْعَلْهُ مِنكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ السَّبِيلِإِن يَثْقَفُوكُمْ يَكُونُواْ لَكُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَيَبْسُطُواْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِالسُّوءِ</p><p>(And whosoever of you does that, then indeed he has gone astray from the straight path. Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil,) meaning, `if they gain the upper hand over you, they would use every type of harm in their disposal to hurt you in words and action,'</p><p>وَوَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ</p><p>(and they desire that you should disbelieve.) meaning, `they are eager that you do not earn any good. Therefore, their enmity to you is outward and inward, so how can you become supporters of this type of people' This also encourages the enmity. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَـمُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>(Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. He will judge between you. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.) means, `your family relations will not benefit you with Allah if Allah decided to cause harm your way. Your relations will not benefit you if you please them with what angers Allah.' Those who agree with their family being disbelievers in order to please them will have earned loss and failure and their deeds will be rendered invalid. Their relation will not benefit them with Allah, even if their relation was with a Prophet. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that a man said, ""O Allah's Messenger! Where is my father"" He said,</p><p>«فِي النَّار»</p><p>(In the Fire.) When the man went away, the Prophet called him back and said:</p><p>«إِنَّ أَبِي وَأَبَاكَ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(Verily, my father and your father are in the Fire.) Muslim and Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith.</p>"

5154,"<h2>The Good Example of Ibrahim and His Followers, when They disowned Their Disbelieving People</h2><p>Allah the Exalted says to His faithful servants, whom He commanded to disown the disbelievers, to be enemies with them, and to distant themselves and separate from them:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ</div><p>(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him,) meaning, his followers who believed in him,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِذْ قَالُواْ لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَءآؤاْ مِّنْكُمْ</div><p>(when they said to their people: ""Verily we are free from you..."") meaning, `we disown you,'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ</div><p>(and whatever you worship besides Allah: we rejected you,) meaning, `we disbelieve in your religion and way,'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَآءُ أَبَداً</div><p>(and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever) meaning, `Animosity and enmity have appeared between us and you from now and as long as you remain on your disbelief; we will always disown you and hate you,'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">حَتَّى تُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ</div><p>(until you believe in Allah alone,) meaning, `unless, and until, you worship Allah alone without partners and disbelieve in the idols and rivals that you worship besides Him.' Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلاَّ قَوْلَ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ لاّسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ</div><p>(except the saying of Ibrahim to his father: ""Verily, I will ask forgiveness (from Allah) for you..."") means, `you have a good example in Ibrahim and his people; as for Ibrahim's prayers for Allah his father, it was a promise that he made for his father.' When Ibrahim became sure that his father was an enemy of Allah, he declared himself innocent of him. Some of the believers used to invoke Allah for their parents who died as disbelievers, begging Him to forgive them. They did so claiming that Ibrahim used to invoke Allah to forgive his father. Allah the Exalted said in reply,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِىِّ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُواْ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ أُوْلِى قُرْبَى مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَحِيمِ - وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ إِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ </div><p>(It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's forgiveness for the idolators, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief). And Ibrahim's request for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he made to him .But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him. Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah and was forbearing.) (9:113-114) Allah said here,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُواْ لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَءآؤاْ مِّنْكُمْ</div><p>(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him, when they said to their people: ""Verily, we are free from you..."") until,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلاَّ قَوْلَ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ لاّسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ وَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ</div><p>(... except the saying of Ibrahim to his father: ""Verily, I will ask forgiveness for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allah."") meaning, `You cannot follow Ibrahim's example as proof in the case mentioned here, as being allowed to ask Allah to forgive those who died on Shirk.' This is the saying of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ad-Dahhak and several others. Allah the Exalted said that Ibrahim and his companions, who parted with their people and disowned their way, said afterwards, while invoking Allah in humility and submission,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">رَّبَّنَا عَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(Our Lord!

Or they will say, `Had these people been following the truth, the torment would not have struck them'."" Ad-Dahhak said something similar. Qatadah said, ""Do not give the disbelievers victory over us, thus subjecting us to trials by their hands. Surely, if You do so, they would then think that they were given victory over us because they are on the truth."" This is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: ""Do not give them dominance over us, lest we suffer trials by their hands.""

In this case, the hearts will come together in agreement, just as Allah said when He mentioned His favor on the Ansar,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُم أَعْدَآءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَاناً وَكُنتُمْ عَلَى شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُمْ مِّنْهَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His grace, you became brethren and were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it.) (3:103) Also the Prophet said to them,</p><p>«أَلَمْ أَجِدْكُمْ ضُلَّالًا فَهَدَاكُمُ اللهُ بِي، وَكُنْتُمْ مُتَفَرِّقِينَ فَأَلَّفَكُمُ اللهُ بِي؟»</p><p>(Did I not find you misguided, and Allah guided you through me; and divided, and Allah united your hearts through me) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَإِن يُرِيدُواْ أَن يَخْدَعُوكَ فَإِنَّ حَسْبَكَ اللَّهُ هُوَ الَّذِى أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِ وَبِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ - وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ لَوْ أَنفَقْتَ مَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً مَّآ أَلَّفْتَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(He it is Who has supported you with His help and with the believers. And He has united their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah has united them. Certainly He is Almighty, All-Wise.) (8:62,63) And in the Hadith:</p><p>«أَحْبِبْ حَبِيبَكَ هَوْنًا مَا، فَعَسَى أَنْ يَكُونَ بَغِيضَكَ يَوْمًا مَا، وَأَبْغِضْ بَغِيضَكَ هَوْنًا مَا، فَعَسَى أَنْ يَكُونَ حَبِيبَكَ يَوْمًا مَا»</p><p>(Love your loved one moderately, because one day, he might become your enemy. Hate your hated one moderately, because one day, he might become your loved one.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) means, Allah forgives the disbelief of the disbelievers if they repent from it, returned to their Lord and surrendered to Him in Islam. Surely, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful to those who repent to Him from their sins, no matter what type of the sin it is.</p><h2>The Permissibility of being Kind to Disbelievers who do not fight against the Religion And Allah's statement;</h2><p>لاَّ يَنْهَـكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَـتِلُوكُمْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُمْ مِّن دِيَـرِكُمْ</p><p>(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes,) means, those who did not have a role in your expulsion. Therefore, Allah does not forbid you from being kind to the disbelievers who do not fight you because of the religion, such as women and weak disbelievers,</p><p>أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ</p><p>(to deal kindly) to be gentle with them,</p><p>وَتُقْسِطُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(and justly with those) to be fair with them</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Abu Bakr said, ""My mother, who was an idolatress at the time, came to me during the Treaty of Peace, the Prophet conducted with the Quraysh. I came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah's Messenger! My mother came visiting, desiring something from me, should I treat her with good relations' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ صِلِي أُمَّك»</p><p>(Yes. Keep good relation with your mother.)"" The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Zubayr said, ""Qutaylah came visiting her daughter, Asma' bint Abi Bakr, with some gifts, such as Dibab, cheese and clarified (cooking) butter, and she was an idolatress at that time. Asma' refused to accept her mother's gifts and did not let her enter her house. `A'ishah asked the Prophet about his verdict and Allah sent down the Ayah,</p><p>لاَّ يَنْهَـكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَـتِلُوكُمْ فِى الدِّينِ</p><p>(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion) until the end of the Ayah. Allah's Messenger ﷺ ordered Asma' to accept her mother's gifts and to let her enter her house."" Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p><p>(Allah loves those who deal with equity.) was duly explained in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hujurat. We also mentioned the authentic Hadith,</p><p>«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عَلى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الْعَرْشِ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهَالِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»</p><p>(The just, who are fair in their decisions, families and those under their authority, will be on podiums made of light, to the right of the Throne.)</p><h2>The Prohibition of being Kind towards Combatant Disbelievers</h2><p>إِنَّمَا يَنْهَـكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ قَـتَلُوكُمْ فِى الدِّينِ وَأَخْرَجُوكُم مِّن دِيَـرِكُمْ وَظَـهَرُواْ عَلَى إِخْرَجِكُمْ أَن تَوَلَّوْهُمْ</p><p>(It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out that Allah forbids you to befriend them.) (60:9) means, `Allah forbids you from being kind and befriending with the disbelievers who are openly hostile to you, those who fought against you, expelled you and helped to expel you. Allah the Exalted forbids you from being their friends and orders you to be their enemy.' Then Allah stresses His threat against being friends with them, by saying,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</p><p>(And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the wrongdoers.) As He said;</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَـرَى أَوْلِيَآءَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as protecting friends, they are but protecting friends of each other. And if any among you takes them (as protecting friends), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the wrongdoers) (5:51)</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا جَآءَكُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَـتُ مُهَـجِرَتٍ فَامْتَحِنُوهُنَّ اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَـنِهِنَّ فَإِنْ عَلِمْتُمُوهُنَّ مُؤْمِنَـتٍ فَلاَ تَرْجِعُوهُنَّ إِلَى الْكُفَّارِ لاَ هُنَّ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحِلُّونَ لَهُنَّ وَءَاتُوهُم مَّآ أَنفَقُواْ وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ إِذَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَلاَ تُمْسِكُواْ بِعِصَمِ الْكَوَافِرِ وَاسْـَلُواْ مَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ وَلْيَسْـَلُواْ مَآ أَنفَقُواْ ذَلِكُمْ حُكْمُ اللَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌوَإِن فَاتَكُمْ شَىْءٌ مِّنْ أَزْوَجِكُمْ إِلَى الْكُفَّـرِ فَعَـقَبْتُمْ فَآتُواْ الَّذِينَ ذَهَبَتْ أَزْوَجُهُمْ مِّثْلَ مَآ أَنفَقُواْ وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ الَّذِى أَنتُمْ بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ</p>"

5164,"<h2>Which was revealed in Madina</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat As-Saff</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Salam said, ""We asked, `Who among us should go to the Messenger ﷺ and ask him about the dearest actions to Allah' None among us volunteered. The Messenger ﷺ sent a man to us and that man gathered us and recited this Surah, Surat As-Saff, in its entirety.""'</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Chastising Those Who say what They do not do</h2><p>We mentioned in many a places before the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.) Therefore, we do not need to repeat its meaning here. Allah's statement,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do) This refutes those who neglect to fulfill their promises. This honorable Ayah supports the view that several scholars of the Salaf held, that it is necessary to fulfill the promise, regardless of whether the promise includes some type of wealth for the person receiving the promise or otherwise. They also argue from the Sunnah, with the Hadith recorded in the Two Sahihs in which Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا اؤْتُمِنَ خَان»</p><p>(There are three signs for a hypocrite: when he promises, he breaks his promise; when speaks, he lies; and when he is entrusted, he betrays.) And in another Hadith in the Sahih,</p><p>«أَرْبَعٌ مَنْ كُنَّ فِيهِ كَانَ مُنَافِقًا خَالِصًا،وَمَنْ كَانَتْ فِيهِ وَاحِدَةٌ مِنْهُنَّ كَانَتْ فِيهِ خَصْلَةٌ مِنْ نِفَاقٍ حَتْى يَدَعَهَا»</p><p>(There are four characteristics which if one has all of them, he is the pure hypocrite, and if anyone has any of them, he has a characteristic of hypocrisy, until he abandons it.) So he mentioned breaking the promise among these four characteristics. We mentioned the meaning of these two Hadiths in the beginning of the explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari, and to Allah is the praise and the thanks. Therefore Allah implied this meaning, when He continued His admonishment by saying,</p><p>كَبُرَ مَقْتاً عِندَ اللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do.) Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amir bin Rabi`ah said, ""Allah's Messenger ﷺ came to us while I was a young boy, and I went out to play. My mother said, `O `Abdullah! Come, I want to give you something.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said to her,</p><p>«وَمَا أَرَدْتِ أَنْ تُعْطِيَهُ؟»</p><p>(What did you want to give him) She said, `Dates.' He said,</p><p>«أَمَا إِنَّكِ لَوْ لَمْ تَفْعَلِي كُتِبَتْ عَلَيْكِ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(If you had not given them to him, it would have been written as a lie in your record.)"" Muqatil bin Hayyan said, ""The faithful believers said, `If we only knew the dearest good actions to Allah, we would perform them.' Thus, Allah told them about the dearest actions to Him,saying,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الَّذِينَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِهِ صَفّاً</p><p>(Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His cause in rows) Allah stated what He likes, and they were tested on the day of Uhud. However, they retreated and fled, leaving the Prophet behind. It was about their case that Allah revealed this Ayah:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do) Allah says here, `The dearest of you to Me, is he who fights in My cause.""' Some said that it was revealed about the gravity of fighting in battle, when one says that he fought and endured the battle, even though he did not do so. Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said that this Ayah was sent down to admonish some people who used to say that they killed, fought, stabbed, and did such and such during battle, even though they did not do any of it. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الَّذِينَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِهِ صَفّاً</p><p>(Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His cause in rows (ranks)) ""Before Allah's Messenger ﷺ began the battle against the enemy, he liked to line up his forces in rows; in this Surah, Allah teaches the believers to do the same."" He also said that Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُم بُنْيَـنٌ مَّرْصُوصٌ</p><p>(as if they were a solid structure.) means, its parts are firmly connected to each other; in rows for battle. Muqatil bin Hayyan said, ""Firmly connected to each other."" Ibn `Abbas commented on the meaning of the Ayah,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُم بُنْيَـنٌ مَّرْصُوصٌ</p><p>(as if they were a solid structure.) by saying, ""They are like a firm structure that does not move, because its parts are cemented to each other.""</p>"

5168,"<h2>Musa admonishes His People for annoying Him</h2><p>Allah states that His servant and Messenger Musa, son of `Imran, to whom Allah spoke directly, said to his people,</p><p>لِمَ تُؤْذُونَنِى وَقَد تَّعْلَمُونَ أَنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(Why do you annoy me while you know certainly that I am the Messenger of Allah to you) meaning, `why do you annoy me even though you know my truth regarding the Message that I brought you' This brings consolation for Allah's Messenger for what the disbelievers among his people and others did to him. And it orders him to be patient. This is why he once said,</p><p>«رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَى مُوسَى لَقَدْ أُوذِيَ بِأَكْثَرَ مِنْ هَذَا فَصَبَر»</p><p>(May Allah have mercy with Musa: he was annoyed more than this, yet he was patient.) By it believers are prohibited from harming or bothering the Prophet in any way or form. As Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَاذَوْاْ مُوسَى فَبرَّأَهُ اللَّهُ مِمَّا قَالُواْ وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً</p><p>(O you who believe! Be not like those who annoyed Musa, but Allah cleared him of that which they alleged, and he was honorable before Allah.) (33:69) And His saying:</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So, when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away.), means, when the Jews turned away from following the guidance, even though they knew it, Allah turned their hearts away from the guidance. Instead, Allah placed doubts, suspicion and failure in their hearts, just as He said,</p><p>وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And We shall turn their hearts and vision away, as they refused to believe therin for the first time, and we shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly.) And His saying;</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّى وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers' way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and enter him in Hell, what an evil destination it is!) (4:115), and, Similarly Allah said;</p><p>وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(And Allah guides not the people who are rebellious.) (9:24)</p><h2>The Good News of `Isa about Our Prophet and that His Name is Ahmad</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ يبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّراً بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ</p><p>(And when `Isa, son of Maryam, said: ""O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah ﷺ unto you, confirming the Tawrah before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad."") `Isa said, ""The Tawrah conveyed the glad tidings of my coming, and my coming confirms the truth of the Tawrah. I convey the glad tidings of the Prophet who will come after me. He is the unlettered, Makkan, Arab Prophet and Messenger, Ahmad."" `Isa, peace be upon him, is the last and final Messenger from among the Children of Israel. He remained among the Children of Israel for a while, conveying the good news of the coming of Muhammad ﷺ, whose name is also Ahmad, the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger. After Muhammad ﷺ, there will be no prophethood or Messengers. How admirable the Hadith is that Al-Bukhari collected in his Sahih from Jubayr bin Mut`im, who said, ""I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِي أَسْمَاءً: أَنَا مُحَمَّدٌ، وَأَنَا أَحْمَدُ، وَأَنَا الْمَاحِي الَّذِي يَمْحُو اللهُ بِهِ الْكُفْرَ،وَأَنَا الْحَاشِرُ الَّذِي يُحْشَرُ النَّاسُ عَلَى قَدَمَيَّ، وَأَنَا الْعَاقِب»</p><p>(I have names. I am Muhammad and Ahmad. I am Al-Mahi through whom Allah will eliminate disbelief. I am Al-Hashir who will be the first to be resurrected, with the people being resurrected Hereafter. I am also Al-`Aqib (i.e., there will be no Prophet after me)."") Also Muslim collected this Hadith from Az-Zuhri from Jubayr. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Khalid bin Ma`dan said that some Companions of Allah's Messenger said, ""O Allah's Messenger! Tell us about yourself."" He said,</p><p>«دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى، وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي حِينَ حَمَلَتْ بِي كَأَنَّهُ خَرَجَ مِنْها نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ بُصْرَى مِنْ أَرْضِ الشَّام»</p><p>(I am the (result of the) invocation made to Allah from my father Ibrahim and the good news `Isa delivered. When my mother was pregnant with me, she had a dream in which she saw a light emanating from her that radiated the palaces of Busra in Ash-Sham."" This Hadith has a good chain of narration that is supported by other similar narrations. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-`Irbad bin Sariyah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنِّي عِنْدَ اللهِ لَخَاتَمُ النَّبِيِّينَ، وَإِنَّ آدَمَ لَمُنْجَدِلٌ فِي طِينَتِهِ، وَسَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَوَّلِ ذَلِكَ: دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبِشَارَةُ عِيسَى بِي، وَرُؤْيَا أُمِّي الَّتِي رَأَتْ، وَكَذَلِكَ أُمَّهَاتُ النَّبِيِّينَ يَرَيْن»</p><p>(I was written with Allah as the Last and Final of the Prophet, even when Adam was still clay. I will tell of the first good news announcing my advent, the (result of the) invocation to Allah made from my father Ibrahim, the good news `Isa conveyed, and the dream that my mother saw. The mothers of all Prophets see similar dreams."") Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said, ""I said, `O Allah's Messenger! What was the first good news of your coming' He said,</p><p>«دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى، وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي أَنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ الشَّام»</p><p>(The (result of the) invocation to Allah made from my father Ibrahim and the good news `Isa conveyed. My mother saw a light emanating from her that filled the palaces of Ash- Sham in a dream.)"" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent eighty men, including `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ja`far bin Abi Talib, `Abdullah bin `Urfutah, `Uthman bin Maz`un, Abu Musa, and others, to An-Najashi. The Quraysh sent `Amr bin Al-`As and `Umarah bin Al-Walid with a gift for An-Najashi. When they, `Amr and `Umarah, came to An-Najashi, they prostrated before him and stood to his right and left. `Amr and `Umarah said, ""Some of our cousins migrated to your land; they have abandoned us and our religion."" An-Najashi said, ""Where are they"" They said, ""They are in your land, so send for them,"" so An-Najashi summoned the Muslims. Ja`far said to the Muslims, ""I will be your speaker today."" So, the Muslims followed Ja`far and when he entered on the king he did not prostrate after greeting him. They said to Ja`far, ""Why do you not prostrate before the king"" Ja`far said, ""We only prostrate for Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored."" They said, ""Why"" He said, ""Allah has sent a Messenger to us from Him, who ordered us not to prostrate to anyone except Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He also ordered to perform prayer and give charity."" `Amr bin Al-`As said, ""They contradict your creed about `Isa, son of Maryam."" The king asked, ""What do you say about `Isa and his mother Maryam"" Ja`far said, ""We only say what Allah said about him, that he is Allah's Word, a soul created by Allah and sent down to the honorable virgin who was not touched by a man nor bearing children before."" An-Najashi lifted a straw of wood and said, ""O Ethiopians, monks and priests! By Allah, what they say about `Isa is no more than what we say about him, not even a difference that equals this straw. You are welcomed among us, and greetings to him who sent you. I bear witness that he is Allah's Messenger ﷺ whom we read about in the Injil. He is the Prophet who `Isa, son of Maryam, foretold the good news about his advent. Live wherever you wish. By Allah, had I not been entrusted with the responsibilities of kingship, I would have gone to him, so that I could be honored by carrying his slippers and his water for ablution."" The king ordered that the gifts of the idolators be returned to them. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud soon returned and later on participated in the battle of Badr. He said that when the Prophet received the news that An-Najashi died, he invoked Allah to forgive him. Allah said,</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said: ""This is plain magic."") this refers to Ahmad, who was anticipated, in accordance with the early Scriptures and early generations, according to Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Jarir. When the Prophet appeared bringing clear signs, the disbelievers and rejecters said,</p><p>هَـذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(This is plain magic)</p>"

Their attempts are similar to one's attempt to extinguish the sun with his mouth, which is impossible. Likewise is the case of their attempt to extinguish truth. So Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِئُواْ نُورَ اللَّهِ بِأَفْوَهِهِمْ وَاللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَـفِرُونَ - هُوَ الَّذِى أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْمُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it). He it is Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it victorious over all (other) religions even though the idolators hate (it).) We explained the meanings of similar Ayat before, in the Tafsir of Surah Bara'ah. All praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"

5173,"<h2>The Trade that saves One from the Painful Torment</h2><p>We mentioned a Hadith from `Abdullah bin Salam in that the Companions wanted to ask the Prophet of Allah about the best actions with Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, so they could practice them. Allah the Exalted sent down this Surah, including this Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكمْ عَلَى تِجَـرَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ </div><p>(O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment) Allah then explained this great trade that will never fail, the trade that will earn one what he wishes and saves him from what he dislikes. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know!) this is better than the trade of this life and striving hard for it and amassing it. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ</div><p>(He will forgive you your sins,) meaning, `if you fulfill what I commanded you and guided you to, then I will forgive your sins and admit you into the Gardens of Paradise. In them, you will have exalted residences and high postitions.' This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيُدْخِلْكُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ وَمَسَـكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِى جَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</div><p>(and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn (Eternal) Paradise; that is indeed the great success.) Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأُخْرَى تُحِبُّونَهَا</div><p>(And also another (blessing) which you love,) meaning, `I will grant you more favors that you like,'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">نَصْرٌ مِّن اللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ</div><p>(help from Allah and a near victory.) meaning, if you fight in Allah's cause and support His religion, He will grant you victory. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ </div><p>(O you who believe!

5178,"<h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Jumu`ah</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas and Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to recite Surat Al-Jumu`ah and Surat Al-Munafiqin during the Friday Prayer. Muslim collected this Hadith in his Sahih.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Everything praises and glorifies Allah Allah states that everything in the heavens and the earth glo</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ</p><p>(Glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise) (17:44) Allah said,</p><p>الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ</p><p>(the King, the Holy,) meaning that He is the Owner and King of the heavens and the earth Who has perfect control over their affairs. He is the Holy, free of all shortcomings, His attributes are perfect,</p><p>العَزِيزُ الحَكِيمُ</p><p>(the Almighty, the All-Wise.) whose explanation is already discussed in many places.</p><h2>The Favor that Allah granted by sending Muhammad ﷺ</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى بَعَثَ فِى الأُمِّيِّينَ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves,) the word `unlettered' here refers to the Arabs. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ وَالاٍّمِّيِّينَ ءَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ</p><p>(And say to those who were given the Scripture and those who are illiterates: ""Do you submit yourselves If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message; and Allah is All-Seer of (His) servants.) (3:20) Mentioning the unlettered ones in specific here does not mean that Muhammad ﷺ was only sent to them, because the blessing to the Arabs is greater than that of other nations. In another Ayah, Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Reminder for you and your people) (43:44). Surely, the Qur'an is also a reminder for those other than Arabs to take heed. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred.) (26:214) These Ayat do not negate Allah's statements,</p><p>قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</p><p>(Say: ""O mankind! verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.) (7:158), and,</p><p>لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ</p><p>(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) (6:19) and in His statement about the Qur'an,</p><p>وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ</p><p>(But those of the groups that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) (11:17) There are other Ayat that indicate that his Message is universal. He, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, was sent to all people, mankind and the Jinns alike. We mentioned this meaning before in Surat Al-An`am producing various Ayat and Hadiths. All praise and thanks are to due to Allah. This Ayah testifies that Allah has indeed accepted the invocation of His friend Ibrahim when he supplicated Allah to send a Messenger to the people of Makkah from among them their own. One who will recite to them Allah's statements, purify them and teach them the Book and the Hikmah. So, Allah -- all praise and thanks be to Him -- sent him when the Messengers ceased and the way was obscure. Indeed it was a time when it was most needed. Especially since Allah hated the people of the earth, Arabs and non-Arabs alike, except for a few of the People of the Scripture, who kept to the true faith Allah the Exalted sent to `Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him. This is why Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى بَعَثَ فِى الأُمِّيِّينَ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ لَفِى ضَلَلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Ayat, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and the Hikmah. And verily, they had been before in manifest error.) In ancient times, the Arabs used to adhere by the religion of Ibrahim, peace be upon him. They later changed, corrupted and contradicted it, choosing polytheism instead of Tawhid and doubts instead of certainty. They invented a religion that Allah did not legislate, just as the People of the Scriptures did when they changed and corrupted their Divine Books. Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ, with a great divine legislation, perfect religion that is suitable for all humans and Jinns. In it, there is guidance and explanations of all that they need in this life and the Hereafter. It draws them closer to Paradise and Allah's pleasure and takes them away from the Fire and earning Allah's anger. In it, there is the final judgement for all types of doubts and suspicion for all major and minor matters of the religion. In Muhammad ﷺ, Allah gathered all the good qualities of the Prophets before him, and gave him what He has never given the earlier and later generations of mankind. May Allah's peace and blessings be on Muhammad ﷺ until the Day of Judgement.</p><h2>Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger to Arabs and Non-Arabs alike</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَءَاخَرِينَ مِنْهُمْ لَمَّا يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِمْ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(And others among them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.) Imam Abu `Abdullah Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy upon him, recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""We were sitting with the Prophet , when Surat Al-Jumu`ah was revealed to him;</p><p>وَءَاخَرِينَ مِنْهُمْ لَمَّا يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِمْ</p><p>(And others among them who have not yet joined them.) They said, `Who are they, O Allah's Messenger' The Prophet did not reply until they repeated the question thrice. At that time, Salman Al-Farisi was with us. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ placed his hand on Salman, saying,</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَ الْإِيمَانُ عِنْدَ الثُّرَيَّا لَنَالَهُ رِجَالٌ أَوْ رَجُلٌ مِنْ هؤُلَاءِ»</p><p>(If faith were on Ath-Thurayya (Pleiades), even then some men or a man from these people would attain it.)"" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa`i, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir collected this Hadith. This Hadith indicates that Surat Al-Jumu`ah was revealed in Al-Madinah and that the Messenger's Message is universal. The Prophet explained Allah's statement,</p><p>وَءَاخَرِينَ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(And others among them) by mentioning Persia. This is why the Prophet sent messages to the kings of Persia and Rome, among other kings, calling them to Allah the Exalted and to follow what he was sent with. This is why Mujahid and several others said that Allah's statement,</p><p>وَءَاخَرِينَ مِنْهُمْ لَمَّا يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِمْ</p><p>(And others among them who have not yet joined them.) refers to all non-Arabs who believe in the truth of the Prophet. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.) asserts that He is Almighty and All-Wise in His legislation and the destiny He appoints. Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(That is the grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of mighty grace.) refers to the great prophethood that He granted Muhammad and the qualities that He favored his Ummah with, by sending Muhammad to them.</p>"

5182,"<h2>Admonishing the Jews and challenging Them to wish for Death</h2><p>Allah the Exalted admonishes the Jews who were entrusted with the Tawrah and were ordered to abide by it. However, they did not abide by it, and this is why Allah resembled them to the donkey that carries volumes of books. Surely, when the donkey carries books, it will not understand what these books contain because it is only carrying these books using its strength. This is the example of those who were entrusted with the Tawrah; they read its letter but did not understand its meanings nor abided by them. Rather, they even corrupted and changed the Tawrah. Therefore, they are worse than the donkey, because the donkey cannot understand. They, on the other hand, could have understood using their minds, but their minds were of no benefit. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ كَالأَنْعَـمِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْغَـفِلُونَ</p><p>(They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless.) (7:179), and said,</p><p>بِئْسَ مَثَلُ الْقَوْمِ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayat of Allah. And Allah does not guide the people who are wrongdoers.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ إِن زَعمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</p><p>(Say: ""O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of other people, then long for death if you are truthful."") meaning, `if you claim that you are on the correct guidance and that Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions are being led astray, then invoke Allah to bring death to the misguided group among the two, if you are truthful in your claim.' Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَتَمَنَّونَهُ أَبَداً بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْديهِمْ</p><p>(But they will never long for it, because of what their hands have sent before them!) meaning because of the disbelief, injustice and sins that they commit,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّـلِمينَ</p><p>(And Allah knows well the wrongdoers.) We mentioned this challenge to the Jews before in Surat Al-Baqarah, where Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَتْ لَكُمُ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ اللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِّن دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ - وَلَن يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَدًا بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّـلِمينَ - وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ النَّاسِ عَلَى حَيَوةٍ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ أَن يُعَمَّرَ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Say: ""If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is indeed for you specially and not for others, of mankind, then long for death if you are truthful."" But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent forth before them. And Allah is Aware of the wrongdoers. And verily, you will find them the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who ascribe partners to Allah. One of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from punishment. And Allah is Seer of what they do.) (2:94-96) We explained these meanings there, stating that the challenge was for the Jews to invoke Allah to destroy the misguided group, either they or their enemies. We also mentioned a similar challenge against the Christians in Surah Al `Imran,</p><p>فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَـذِبِينَ</p><p>(Then whoever disputes with you concerning him `Isa after (all this) knowledge that has come to you, say: ""Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves -- then we pray and invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie."")(3:61) and against the idolators, in Surah Maryam,</p><p>قُلْ مَن كَانَ فِى الضَّلَـلَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ لَهُ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَدّاً</p><p>(Say whoever is in error, the Most Gracious will extend circumstances for him.)(19:75) Imam Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, `If I see Muhammad ﷺ praying at the Ka`bah, I will step on his neck.' When the Prophet heard of that, he said,</p><p>«لَوْ فَعَلَ لَأَخَذَتْهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عَيَانًا وَلَوْ أَنَّ الْيَهُودَ تَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ لَمَاتُوا وَرَأَوْا مَقَاعِدَهُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ، وَلَوْ خَرَجَ الَّذِينَ يُبَاهِلُونَ رَسُولَ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم لَرَجَعُوا لَا يَجِدُونَ أَهْلًا وَلَا مَالًا»</p><p>(Had he done so, the angels would have snatched him away in public. Had the Jews wished for death, they would all have perished and saw their seats in Hellfire. Had those accepted for invoking the curse of Allah with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, they would not have found families or property when they returned home.)"" Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded it. His saying;</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّ الْمَوْتَ الَّذِى تَفِرُّونَ مِنْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مُلَـقِيكُمْ ثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Say: ""Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you, then you will be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you about what you used to do."") is like His saying in Surat An-Nisa':</p><p>أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ</p><p>(Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high.)</p>"

5186,"<h2>Al-Jumu`ah (Friday), and the Orders and Etiquette for Friday</h2><p>Friday is called Al-Jumu`ah because it is derived from Al-Jam`, literally, gathering. The people of Islam gather weekly, on every Friday in the major places of worship. It was during Friday when Allah finished the creation, the sixth day, during which Allah created the heavens and earth. During Friday, Allah created Adam, and he was placed in Paradise, and ironically, it was a Friday when he was taken out of Paradise. It will be on a Friday when the Last Hour will commence. There is an hour during Friday, wherein no faithful servant asks Allah for something good, but Allah will give him what he asked for. All of this is based upon Hadiths in the authenic collections. In the ancient language Friday was called, `Arubah. It is a fact that previous nations were informed about Friday, but they were led astray from it. The Jews chose Saturday for their holy day, but Adam was not created on Saturday. The Christians chose Sunday, which is the day the creation was initiated. Allah chose Friday for this Ummah, because it is the day the creation was finished.Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، بَيْدَ أَنَّهُمْ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا، ثُمَّ إِنَّ هَذَا يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِي فَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِمْ فَاخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ فَهَدَانَا اللهُ لَهُ، فَالنَّاسُ لَنَا فِيهِ تَبَعٌ، الْيَهُودُ غَدًا وَالنَّصَارَى بَعْدَ غَدٍ»</p><p>(We are the last (to come) but the first on the Day of Resurrection, though the former nations were given the Scriptures before us. And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them, but they differed about it. So, Allah gave us guidance to it, and all other people are coming after us: the Jews tomorrow and the Christians the day after tomorrow."" This is the wording of Al-Bukhari in another narration of Muslim;</p><p>«أَضَلَّ اللهُ عَنِ الْجُمُعَةِ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَنَا، فَكَانَ لِلْيَهُودِ يَوْمُ السَّبْتِ، وَكَانَ لِلنَّصَارَى يَوْمُ الْأَحَدِ، فَجَاءَ اللهُ بِنَا فَهَدَانَا اللهُ لِيَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ، فَجَعَلَ الْجُمُعَةَ وَالسَّبْتَ وَالْأَحَدَ، وَكَذَلِكَ هُمْ تَبَعٌ لَنَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الدُّنْيَا، وَالْأَوَّلُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ الْمَقْضِيُّ بَيْنَهُمْ قَبْلَ الْخَلَائِقِ»</p><p>(Allah diverted those who were before us from Friday. For the Jews there was Saturday, and for the Christians there was Sunday. Allah then brought us and guided us to Friday. He made them; Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and it is in this order they will come after us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of among the people of this world and the first among the created to be judged on the Day of Resurrection.)</p><h2>Necessity of the Remembrance of Allah on Friday, by attending the Khutbah and the Prayer</h2><p>Allah commanded the believers to gather to worship Him on Friday,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْاْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Al-Jumu`ah (Friday), then hasten (Fas`aw) to the remembrance of Allah) meaning, go to it and head for it. The meaning of Sa`y (hasten) here does not refer to walking quickly. It only refers to the importance of it. `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Ibn Mas`ud - may Allah be pleased with them - recited it; (فَامْضُوا إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللهِ) (""Then proceed to the remembrance of Allah."") As for walking in haste to the prayer, that was indeed prohibited, since it was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِذَا سَمِعْتُمُ الْإِقَامَةَ فَامْشُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّكِينَةَ وَالْوَقَارَ وَلَا تُسْرِعُوا، فَمَا أَدْرَكْتُمْ فَصَلُّوا وَمَا فَاتَكُمْ فَأَتِمُّوا»</p><p>(When you hear the Iqamah, proceed to offer the prayer with calmness and solemnity and do not rush. And pray whatever you catch, and complete whatever you have missed.) This is the wording with Al-Bukhari. Abu Qatadah said, ""While we were praying behind the Messenger of Allah ﷺ he heard commotion. At the end of the prayer, the Prophet said;</p><p>«مَا شَأْنُكُمْ»</p><p>(What is the matter with you) They said, `We hastened to the prayer.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«فَلَا تَفْعَلُوا، إِذَا أَتَيْتُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَامْشُوا وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّكِينَةَ فَمَا أَدْرَكْتُمْ فَصَلُّوا وَمَا فَاتَكُمْ فَأَتِمُّوا»</p><p>(Don't do that. When you come for prayer, there should be tranquility upon you. Pray what remains of the prayer and complete what you have missed.)"" The Two Sahihs collected this Hadith. Al-Hasan commented, ""By Allah! Hastening to the prayer is not accomplished by the feet. Indeed they were prohibited from coming to prayer without tranquility and dignity. Rather it is about the hearts, the intention, and the submission."" Qatadah said,</p><p>فَاسْعَوْاْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p>""(then hasten to the remembrance of Allah) means that you have to hasten to the prayer with your heart and actions, and walk to it."" It is recommended for those coming to the Friday prayer to perform Ghusl (taking bath) before they come. It is collected in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا جَاءَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْجُمُعَةَ فَلْيَغْتَسِلْ»</p><p>(When one of you comes to the Friday prayer, then let him perform bath.) The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Sa`id said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«غُسْلُ يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ وَاجِبٌ عَلى كُلِّ مُحْتَلِمٍ»</p><p>(Ghusl on the day of Jumu`ah is Wajib (required) from every Muhtalim. ) Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«حَقٌّ لله عَلى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ أَنْ يَغْتَسِلَ فِي كُلِّ سَبْعَةِ أَيَّامٍ، يَغْسِلُ رَأْسَهُ وَجَسَدَهُ»</p><p>(It is Allah's right on every Muslim to bathe during every seven days, by washing his head and body.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Jabir narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«عَلى كُلِّ رَجُلٍ مُسْلِمٍ فِي كُلِّ سَبْعَةِ أَيَّامٍ غُسْلُ يَوْمٍ وَهُوَ يَوْمُ الْجُمُعَةِ»</p><p>(Within every seven days, every Muslim man has the obligation to perform Ghusl at least one day, the day of Jumu`ah.) Ahmad, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Virtues of Jumu`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Aws bin `Aws Ath-Thaqafi said that he heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ غَسَّلَ وَاغْتَسَلَ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ وَبَكَّرَ وَابْتَكَرَ وَمَشَى وَلَمْ يَرْكَبْ، وَدَنَا مِنَ الْإِمَامِ وَاسْتَمَعَ وَلَمْ يَلْغُ، كَانَ لَهُ بِكُلِّ خُطْوَةٍ أَجْرُ سَنَةٍ صِيَامُهَا وَقِيَامُهَا»</p><p>(Whoever performs Ghusl (well) on the day of Jumu`ah, leaves early, walking not riding, and sits close to the Imam and listens without talking, will earn the reward of fasting and performing standing (in prayer) for an entire year for every step he takes.) This Hadith has various chains of narration, the compilers of the Four Sunan collected it, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan. The Two Sahihs also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنِ اغْتَسَلَ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ غُسْلَ الْجَنَابَةِ ثُمَّ رَاحَ فِي السَّاعَةِ الْأُولَى فَكَأَنَّمَا قَرَّبَ بَدَنَةً، وَمَنْ رَاحَ فِي السَّاعَةِ الثَّانِيَةِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَرَّبَ بَقَرَةً، وَمَنْ رَاحَ فِي السَّاعَةِ الثَّالِثَةِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَرَّبَ كَبْشًا أَقْرَنَ، وَمَنْ رَاحَ فِي السَّاعَةِ الرَّابِعَةِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَرَّبَ دَجَاجَةً، وَمَنْ رَاحَ فِي السَّاعَةِ الْخَامِسَةِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَرَّبَ بَيْضَةً، فَإِذَا خَرَجَ الْإِمَامُ حَضَرَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الذِّكْرَ»</p><p>(Any person who takes a bath on Friday like the bath for sexual impurity and then goes for the prayer in the first hour, it is as if he had sacrificed a camel. Whoever goes in the second hour, it is as if he had sacrificed a cow. Whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a horned ram. If one goes in the fourth hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen. Whoever goes in the fifth hour, then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam appears, the angels present themselves to listen to Allah's remembrance.) It is recommended that one cleans his body, performs Ghusl, wears his best clothes, applies perfume and uses Siwak (tooth stick) for Jumu`ah. We mentioned that Abu Sa`id narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«غُسْلُ يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ وَاجِبٌ عَلى كُلِّ مُحْتَلِمٍ وَالسِّوَاكُ وَأَنْ يَمَسَّ مِنْ طِيبِ أَهْلِهِ»</p><p>(Ghusl on the day of Jumu`ah is Wajib (required) from every Muhtalim and also using Siwak and applying some of his household's perfume.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say, </p><p>«مَنِ اغْتَسَلَ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ وَمَسَّ مِنْ طِيبِ أَهْلِهِ إِنْ كَانَ عِنْدَهُ وَلَبِسَ مِنْ أَحْسَنِ ثِيَابِهِ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ حَتْى يَأْتِيَ الْمَسْجِدَ فَيَرْكَعَ إِنْ بَدَا لَهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْذِ أَحَدًا، ثُمَّ أَنْصَتَ إِذَا خَرَجَ إِمَامُهُ حَتْى يُصَلِّيَ كَانَتْ كَفَّارَةً لِمَا بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ الْجُمُعَةِ الْأُخْرَى»</p><p>(Whoever performs Ghusl on Friday and applies perfume, if he has any, wears his best clothes, then goes to the Masjid and performs voluntary prayer, if he wishes, does not bother anyone, listens when the Imam appears until he starts the prayer. Then all of this will be an expiation for whatever occurs between that Friday and the next Friday.) Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded in their Sunans that `Abdullah bin Salam said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say, while on the Minbar:</p><p>«مَا عَلَى أَحَدِكُمْ لَوِ اشْتَرَى ثَوْبَيْنِ لِيَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ سِوَى ثَوْبَيْ مِهْنَتِهِ»</p><p>(What harm would it cause if one of you bought two garments for the day of Jumu`ah, other than the garment he wears daily) `A'ishah said that during a speech he gave on a Friday when he saw people wearing Nimar garments, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا عَلَى أَحَدِكُمْ إِنْ وَجَدَ سَعَةً أَنْ يَتَّخِذَ ثَوْبَيْنِ لِجُمُعَتِهِ سِوَى ثَوْبَيْ مِهْنَتِهِ»</p><p>(When one of you has wealth, he should keep two garments for Friday, other than the two garments he has for his daily wear.) Ibn Majah collected this Hadith.</p><h2>The Meaning of the Call in the Ayah is the Adhan that precedes the Khutbah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ</p><p>(When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Friday,) referring to the Adhan which was called, during the time of the Prophet , when he came out of his house and sat on the Minbar. The Adhan would be called before the Prophet near the door of the Masjid. As for the earlier Adhan that the Leader of the faithful, `Uthman bin Affan added, it was done because the Muslims increased in number during his time. Al-Bukhari recorded that As-Sa'ib bin Yazid said, ""In the lifetime of the Prophet , Abu Bakr and `Umar, the Adhan for the Friday prayer was pronounced while the Imam sat on the pulpit. But during `Uthman's later time when the Muslims increased in number, an additional call was pronouced upon Az-Zawra', meaning the Adhan was called upon the house which was called Az-Zawra""' Az-Zawra' was the tallest house in Al-Madinah near the Masjid.</p><h2>Prohibiting buying and selling after the Call on Friday, and the Exhortation to seek Provisions after it</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَذَرُواْ الْبَيْعَ</p><p>(and leave off business.) means, hastening to the remembrance of Allah and abandoning business, when the call to the Friday prayer is made. Therefore, the scholars of Islam agree, it is prohibited for Muslims to engage in business transactions after the second Adhan. Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(That is better for you if you did but know!) means, `your abandoning buying and selling, and instead, corcentrating your attention to Allah's remembrance and the prayer are better for you in this life and the Hereafter, if you but knew.' Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَوةُ</p><p>(Then when the Salah is complete,) means, when the Friday prayer is finished,</p><p>فَانتَشِرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَابْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(you may disperse through the land, and seek the bounty of Allah,) After Allah forbade Muslims from working after hearing the Adhan and ordered them to gather for the Friday prayer, He allowed them to spread throughout the earth and seek bounty after the prayer is finished. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that when the Friday prayer finished, `Irak bin Malik would stand by the gate of the Masjid and invoke Allah, saying, ""O Allah! I have accepted and complied with Your Call, performed the prayer You ordered and dispersed as You ordered me. Therefore, grant me of Your favor and You are the best of those who grant provisions."" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.) means, while you are buying and selling, giving and taking, remember Allah much and do not let this life busy you from what benefits you in the Hereafter. There is a Hadith that states,</p><p>«مَنْ دَخَلَ سُوقًا مِنَ الْأَسْوَاقِ فَقَالَ: لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، كَتَبَ اللهُ لَهُ أَلْفَ أَلْفِ حَسَنَةٍ وَمَحَا عَنْهُ أَلْفَ أَلْفِ سَيِّئَةٍ»</p><p>(Whoever enters a marketplace and says, ""La ilaha illallah, He is alone without partners, His is the sovreignty and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things."" Then Allah will record a thousand-thousand (a million) good deeds for him and will erase a thousand-thousand evil deeds.) Mujahid said, ""A servant (of Allah) will not be among those who remember Allah often, until he does so while standing, sitting and lying down.""</p>"

In reality, they were not Muslims, but rather the opposite. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِذَا جَآءَكَ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ قَالُواْ نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(When the hypocrites come to you, they say: ""We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah."") meaning, `when the hypocrites come to you, they announce this statement and pretend to believe in it.' Allah informs that there is no substance to their statement, and this is why He said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ</div><p>(Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger,) then said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ لَكَـذِبُونَ</div><p>(And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed.) meaning, their claims, even though it is true about the Prophet. But they did not believe inwardly in what they declared outwardly, and this is why Allah declared their falsehood about their creed. Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">اتَّخَذْواْ أَيْمَـنَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(They have made their oaths a screen. Thus they hinder (others) from the path of Allah.) meaning, the hypocrites shield themselves from Muslims when they falsely and sinfully swear to be what they are not in reality. Some Muslims were deceived because they did not know their falsehood, and thus, thought that they were Muslims. Some Muslims believed what hypocrites say and even imitated them in their outward behavior. However, inwardly, hypocrites seek the destruction of Islam and its people, and this is why trusting them might bring great harm to many people. This is why Allah said next,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(Thus they hinder (others) from the path of Allah. Verily, evil is what they used to do.) Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُواّ ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا فَطُبِعَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ </div><p>(That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not.) meaning, He has decreed them to be hypocrites because they reverted from faith to disbelief and exchanged guidance for misguidance. Therefore, Allah stamped and sealed their hearts and because of it, they cannot comprehend the guidance, nor any goodness can reach their hearts. Truly, their hearts neither understand, nor attain guidance. Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ تُعْجِبُكَ أَجْسَـمُهُمْ وَإِن يَقُولُواْ تَسْمَعْ لِقَوْلِهِمْ</div><p>(And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words.) meaning, hypocrites have a graceful outer appearance and are eloquent. When one hears them speak, he will listen to their eloquent words, even though hypocrites are truly weak and feeble, full of fear, fright and cowardice. Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(They think that every cry is against them.) means, every time an incident occurs or something frightening happens, they think that it is headed their way. This is indicative of their cowardice, just as Allah said about them,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ فَإِذَا جَآءَ الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِى يُغْشَى عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ أَشِحَّةً عَلَى الْخَيْرِ أوْلَـئِكَ لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ فَأَحْبَطَ اللَّهُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيراً </div><p>(Being miserly towards you then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good. Such have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah.) (33:19) They are shapes that do not have much substance, and this is why Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">هُمُ الْعَدُوُّ فَاحْذَرْهُمْ قَاتَلَهُمُ اللَّهُ أَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying the right path) means, how they are being led astray to the misguidance, away from the guidance. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«إِنَّ لِلْمُنَافِقِينَ عَلَامَاتٍ يُعْرَفُونَ بِهَا: تَحِيَّتُهُمْ لَعْنَةٌ وَطَعَامُهُمْ نُهْبَةٌ وَغَنِيمَتُهُمْ غُلُولٌ لَا يَقْرَبُونَ الْمَسَاجِدَ إِلَّا هَجْرًا، وَلَا يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا دَبْرًا، مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ لَا يَأْلَفُونَ وَلَا يُؤْلَفُونَ، خُشُبٌ بِاللَّيْلِ صُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ وفِي رِوَايَةٍ سُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَار»</div><p>(Hypocrites have certain signs that they are known by. Their greeting is really a curse, their food is from stealing and the war booty they collect is from theft. They shun the Masjid and they do not come to the prayer but at its end. They are arrogant; it is neither easy for them to blend in, nor it is easy for people to blend with them. They are like pieces of wood by night and are noisy by day.)</p>"

5193,"<h2>Hypocrites are not interested to ask the prophet to ask Allah to forgive Them</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states about the hypocrites, may Allah curse them,</p><p>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ يَسْتَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ لَوَّوْاْ رُءُوسَهُمْ</p><p>(And when it is said to them: ""Come, so that the Messenger of Allah may ask forgiveness from Allah for you,"" they twist their heads,) meaning, they turn away, ignoring this call in arrogance, belitt- ling what they are invited to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَرَأَيْتَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ وَهُم مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ</p><p>(and you would see them turning away their faces in pride.) Allah punished them for this behavior, saying,</p><p>سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ لَن يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(It is equal to them whether you ask forgiveness or ask not forgiveness for them, Allah will never forgive them. Verily, Allah guides not the people who are the rebellious.) As Allah said in Surat Bara'ah, and a discussion preceded there, and here we will present some of the Hadiths reported that are related to it. Several of the Salaf mentioned that this entire passage was revealed in the case of `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, as we will soon mention, Allah willing and our trust and reliance are on Him. In his book, As-Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq said, ""After the battle of Uhud ended, the Prophet returned to Al-Madinah. `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul -- as Ibn Shihab narrated to me -- would stand up every Friday, without objection from anyone because he was a chief of his people, when the Prophet would sit on the Minbar, just before he delivered the Jumu`ah Khutbah to the people. `Abdullah bin Ubay would say, `O people! This is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with you. Allah has honored us by sending him and gave you might through him. Support him, honor him and listen to and obey him.' He would then sit down. So after the battle of Uhud, even after he did what he did, that is, returning to Al-Madinah with a third of the army, he stood up to say the same words. But the Muslims held on to his clothes and said to him, `Sit down, O enemy of Allah! You are not worthy to stand after you did what you did.' `Abdullah went out of the Masjid crossing people's lines and saying, `By Allah, it is as if I said something awful when I wanted to support him.' Some men from Al-Ansar met him at the gate of the Masjid and asked him what happened. He said, `I just stood up to support him and some men, his Companions, jumped at me, pulled me back and admonished me, as if what I said was an awful thing; I merely wanted to support him.' They said to him, `Woe to you! Go back so that Allah's Messenger asks Allah to forgive you.' He said, `By Allah, I do not wish that he ask Allah to forgive me.""' Qatadah and As-Suddi said, ""This Ayah was revealed about `Abdullah bin Ubay. A young relative of his went to Allah's Messenger and conveyed to him an awful statement that `Abdullah said. The Messenger ﷺ called `Abdullah, who swore by Allah that he did not say anything. The Ansar went to that boy and admonished him. However, Allah sent down what you hear about `Abdullah's case and Allah's enemy was told, `Go to Allah's Messenger,' but he turned his head away, saying that he will not do it."" Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Muhammad bin Yahya bin Hibban, `Abdullah bin Abi Bakr and `Asim bin `Umar bin Qatadah narrated to him the story of Bani Al-Mustaliq. They said that while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was in that area, Jahjah bin Sa`id Al-Ghifari, a hired hand for `Umar, and Sinan bin Wabr fought over the water source. Sinan called out, ""O Ansar"", while Al-Jahjah called, ""O Muhajirin!"" Zayd bin Arqam and several Ansar men were sitting with `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul at that time. When `Abdullah heard what happened, he said, ""They are bothering us in our land. By Allah, the parable of us and these foolish Quraysh men, is the parable that goes, `Feed your dog until it becomes strong, and it will eat you.' By Allah, when we go back to Al-Madinah, the most mighty will expel the weak from it."" He then addressed his people who were sitting with him, saying to them, ""What have you done to yourselves You let them settle in your land and shared your wealth with them. By Allah, if you abandon them, they will have to move to another area other than yours."" Zayd bin Arqam heard these words and conveyed them to Allah's Messenger . Zayd was a young boy then. `Umar bin Al-Khattab was with the Messenger ﷺ and he said, ""O Allah's Messenger! Order `Abbad bin Bishr to cut off his head at his neck."" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«فَكَيْفَ إِذَا تَحَدَّثَ النَّاسُ يَا عُمَرُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَهُ، لَا، وَلَكِنْ نَادِ يَا عُمَرُ الرَّحِيل»</p><p>(What if people started saying that Muhammad kills his companions, O `Umar No. However, order the people to start the journey (back to Al-Madinah).) When `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul was told that his statement reached Allah's Prophet , he went to him and denied saying it. He swore by Allah that he did not utter the statement that Zayd bin Arqam conveyed. `Abdullah bin Ubay was a chief of his people and they said, ""O Allah's Messenger! May be the young boy merely guessed and did not hear what was said correctly."" Allah's Messenger started the journey at an unusual hour of the day and was met by Usayd bin Al-Hudayr, who greeted him acknowledging his prophethood. Usayd said, ""By Allah! You are about to begin the journey at an unusual time."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«أَمَا بَلَغَكَ مَا قَالَ صَاحِبُكَ ابْنُ أُبَيَ؟ زَعَمَ أَنَّهُ إِذَا قَدِمَ الْمَدِينَةَ سَيُخْرِجُ الْأَعَزُّ مِنْهَا الْأَذَل»</p><p>(Did not the statement of your friend, Ibn Ubay reach you He claimed that when he returns to Al-Madinah, the mighty one will expel the weak one out of it.) Usayd said, ""Indeed, you are the mighty one, O Allah's Messenger, and he is the disgraced one."" Usayd said, ""Take it easy with him, O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, when Allah brought you to us, we were about to gather the pearls (of a crown) so that we appoint him king over us. He thinks that you have rid him of his kingship."" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ traveled with the people until the night fell, then the rest of the night until the beginning of the next day and then set camp with the people. He wanted to busy them from talking about what had happened. The minute people felt the ground under their feet, they went to sleep and Surat Al-Munafiqin was revealed. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, ""We were in a battle with Allah's Messenger and a man from the Emigrants kicked an Ansari man. The Ansari man called out, `O Ansar!' and the Emigrant called out, `O Emigrants!' Allah's Messenger heard that and said,</p><p>«مَا بَالُ دَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ؟ دَعُوهَا فَإِنَّهَا مُنْتِنَة»</p><p>(What is this call of Jahiliyyah Abandon it because it is offensive.) `Abdullah bin Ubay heard that and said, `Have they (the Emigrants) done so By Allah, if we return to Al-Madinah, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.' The Ansar at that time, were more numerous that the Emigrants when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to Al-Madinah, but later on the Emigrants imcreased in number. When this statement reached the Prophet , `Umar got up and said, `O Allah's Messenger! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite!' The Prophet said:</p><p>«دَعْهُ، لَا يَتَحَدَّثُ النَّاسُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَه»</p><p>(Leave him, lest the people say that Muhammad kills his companions.)"" Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. `Ikrimah and Ibn Zayd and others said that when the Prophet and his Companions went back to Al-Madinah,`Abdullah, the son of `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, remained by the gate of Al-Madinah holding his sword. People passed by him as they returned to Al-Madinah, and then his father came. `Abdullah, son of `Abdullah, said to his father, ""Stay where you are,"" and his father asked what the matter was His son said, ""By Allah! You will enter through here until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ allows you to do so, for he is the honorable one and you are the disgraced."" When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came by, and he used to be in the last lines, `Abdullah bin Ubay complained to him about his son and his son said, ""By Allah, O Allah's Messenger! He will not enter it until you say so."" The Messenger gave his permission to `Abdullah bin Ubay and his son said, ""Enter, now that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave you his permission."" In his Musnad, Abu Bakr `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr Al-Humaydi recorded from Abu Harun Al-Madani that `Abdullah, the son of `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, said to his father, ""You will never enter Al-Madinah unless and until you say, `Allah's Messenger is the honorable one and I am the disgraced."" When the Prophet came, `Abdullah, son of `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul said to him, ""O Allah's Messenger! I was told that you have decided to have my father executed. By He Who has sent you with Truth, I never looked straight to his face out of respect for him. But if you wish, I will bring you his head, because I would hate to see the killer of my father.""</p>"

Surely, every person who fell into shortcomings will regret it by the time of his death and will ask for respite, even a short period, so that he does better and attains what he missed. No, rather what occurred, has occurred and what is coming, shall indeed come. Each will be held accountable for his mistakes. As for the disbelievers, they will be as Allah said about them,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَنذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ </div><p>(And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say:""Our Lord!

When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife, during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, while she was menstruating. `Umar bin Al-Khattab mentioned that to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Allah's Messenger ﷺ became angry and said,</p><p>«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا ثُمَّ يُمْسِكْهَا حَتْى تَطْهُرَ، ثُمَّ تَحِيضَ فَتَطْهُرَ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يُطَلِّقَهَا، فَلْيُطَلِّقْهَا طَاهِرًا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَمَسَّهَا، فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ بِهَا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p><p>(Order him to take her back and keep her until she is clean from her menses, and then to wait until she gets her next period and becomes clean again. Then, if he wishes to divorce her, he can divorce her when she is clean from her menses, before he has sexual intercourse with her. This is the `Iddah which Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has fixed.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in several parts of his Sahih. Muslim collected this Hadith and his narration uses these words,</p><p>«فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ اللهُ أَنْ يُطَلَّقَ لَهَا النِّسَاء»</p><p>(This is the `Iddah which Allah has fixed for the women being divorced.) In his Sahih, Muslim has recorded a Hadith which is a more appropriate version from a narration of Ibn Jurayj who said that Abu Az-Zubayr informed him that he heard `Abdur-Rahman bin Ayman, the freed slave of `Azzah, questioning `Abdullah bin `Umar. And Abu Az-Zubayr heard the question, ""What about a man who divorces his wife while she is still on her menses"" `Abdullah answered, ""During the time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife who was menstruating in the life time of Allah's Messenger ﷺ. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا»</p><p>(Let him take her back.) so she returned and he said:</p><p>«إِذَا طَهُرَتْ فَلْيُطَلِّقْ أَوْ يُمْسِك»</p><p>(When she is pure, then either divorce or keep her.) `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah: (ياأَيُّها النَّبِيُّ إِذا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّساءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهِنَّ) (O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) And `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ</p><p>(divorce them at their `Iddah) He said, ""Purity without intercourse."" Similar was reported from Ibn `Umar, `Ata', Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, Maymun bin Mihran and Muqatil bin Hayyan. It is also reported from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak.`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas about the Ayah;</p><p>فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ</p><p>(divorce them at their `Iddah), ""He does not divorce her while she is on her menses nor while she is pure if he has had intercourse during that (purity). Rather, he leaves her until she has her menses and after the menses ends, then he divorces her once."" And `Ikrimah said about</p><p>فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ</p><p>(divorce them at their `Iddah), ""The `Iddah is made up of clean- liness and the menstrual period."" So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant, or he does not due to having sex, or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not. This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce, one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated. The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended. One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant. As for the innovated divorce, it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses, or after the menses ends, has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her, even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not. There is a third type of divorce, which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces a young wife who has not begun to have menses, the wife who is beyond the age of having menses, and divorcing one's wife before the marriage was consummated. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ</p><p>(and count their `Iddah.) meaning, count for it and know its beginning and end, so that the `Iddah does not become prolonged for the woman and she cannot get married again,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ</p><p>(And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord.) in this matter.</p><h2>Spending and Housing is up to the Husband during the Revocable `Iddah Period</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ</p><p>(And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave,) meaning, during the duration of the `Iddah, she has the right to housing from her husband, as long as the `Iddah period continues. Therefore, the husband does not have the right to force her out of her house, nor is she allowed to leave his house, because she is still tied to the marriage contract. Allah said,</p><p>إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ</p><p>(except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah.) meaning that the divorced wife is not to abandon her husband's house unless she commits Fahishah Mubayyinah, in which case, she vacates her husband's house. For example, Fahishah Mubayyinah implies adultery, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Sa`id bin Hilal and others. Fahishah Mubayyinah implies disobeying her husband openly or when she abuses her husband's family in words and actions, according to Ubay bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and others. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And those are the set limits of Allah.) means, these are from His legislation and prohibitions,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah,) meaning, whoever violates these limits, transgresses them and implements anything else besides them,</p><p>فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ</p><p>(then indeed he has wronged himself.) by doing so.</p><h2>The Wisdom of `Iddah at the Husband's House</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً</p><p>(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) meaning, `We commanded that the divorced wife remains in her husband's house during the `Iddah period, so that the husband might regret his action and Allah decides that the husband feels in his heart for the marriage to continue.' This way, returning to his wife will be easier for him. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah said that Fatimah bint Qays said about Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً</p><p>(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) ""Taking her back."" Similar was said by Ash-Sha`bi, `Ata', Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ath-Thawri.</p><h2>The Irrevocably Divorced Woman does not have a Right to Provisions and Accommodations from the Husba</h2><p>Here the view of the scholars of the Salaf and those who follow them is that housing is not obligatory in the case of the irrevocably divorced woman. They also relied on the Hadith of Fatimah bint Qays Al-Fihriyah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her the third and final time. He was away from her in Yemen at the time, and he sent her his decision to divorce her. He also sent some barley with his messenger, but she did not like the amount or method of compensation. He said, ""By Allah I am not obligated to spend upon you."" So, she went to Allah's Messenger ﷺ, who said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ لَكِ عَلَيْهِ نَفَقَة»</p><p>(There is no obligation on him to spend on you.) Muslim added in his narration,</p><p>«وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p><p>(nor housing.) And he ordered her to finish her `Iddah period in the house of Umm Sharik. He then said,</p><p>«تِلْكَ امْرَأَةٌ يَغْشَاهَا أَصْحَابِي، اعْتَدِّي عِنْدَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ، فَإِنَّهُ رَجُلٌ أَعْمَى تَضَعِينَ ثِيَابَك»</p><p>(She is a woman my Companions visit. Spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man; he cannot see you if you take off your garments.) Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using another chain of narration. In his narration, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«انْظُرِي يَا بِنْتَ آلِ قَيْسٍ إِنَّمَا النَّفَقَةُ وَالسُّكْنَى لِلْمَرْأَةِ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا، مَا كَانَتْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ فَلَا نَفَقَةَ وَلَا سُكْنَى،اخْرُجِي فَانْزِلِي عَلَى فُلَانَة»</p><p>(Look O daughter of the family of Qays! Spending and housing are required from the husband who can return to his wife. So if he does not have the right to return to her, then she does not have the right to spending and housing. So leave his house and go to so-and-so woman.) He then said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُ يُتَحَدَّثُ إِلَيْهَا، انْزِلِي عَلَى ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْمَى لَا يَرَاك»</p><p>(They speak to her. Therefore, go to Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and cannot see you.) Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that `Amir Ash-Sha`bi went to Fatimah bint Qays, sister of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, from the tribe of Quraysh. Fatimah was married to Abu `Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mughirah, from Bani Makhzum. She said, ""Abu `Amr bin Hafs sent me his decision to divorce me while he was in an army that had gone to Yemen. I asked his friends to provide me with financial provisions and housing. They said, `He did not send us anything for that, nor did he request it from us.' I went to Allah's Messenger and said to him, `O Allah's Messenger! Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced me, and I asked his friends to provide me with spending and housing and they said that he did not send them anything for that.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا السُّكْنَى وَالنَّفَقَةُ لِلْمَرْأَةِ إِذَا كَانَ لِزَوْجِهَا عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ حَتْى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ:فَلَا نَفَقَةَ لَهَا وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p><p>(Spending and housing are required from the husband for his divorced wife if he can return to her. If she is not permitted for him anymore, until she marries another husband, then he does not have to provide her with spending and housing.)"" An-Nasa'i also recorded this narration.</p>"
5219,"<h2>Ordaining Kindness towards Divorced Women</h2><p>Allah the Exalted says that when the woman who is in her `Iddah nears the end of the `Iddah term, the husband must decide to reconcile with her, thus keeping their marriage together,</p><p>بِمَعْرُوفٍ</p><p>(in a good manner) while being kind to her in their companionship. Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners.</p><h2>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</p><p>(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, ""His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct."" Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata' commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</p><p>(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) ""It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse."" Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</p><p>(That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.' This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah's punishment in the Hereafter.</p><h2>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Taqwa of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur'an is,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإْحْسَانِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90). The greatest Ayah in the Qur'an that contains relief is,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)"" `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, ""Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him."" Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak.`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) ""It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives,</p><p>مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(from where he never could imagine.) from resources he did not anticipate"" Qatadah said,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) ""meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death,</p><p>وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(And He will provide him from where he never could imagine) from where he never thought of or anticipated."" Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ</p><p>(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he rode the Prophet's camel while sitting behind the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ، وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف»</p><p>(O boy! I will teach you words so learn them. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah. Know that if the Ummah gather their strength to bring you benefit, they will never bring you benefit, except that which Allah has decreed for you. Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. The pens have been raised and the pages are dry.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said: ""Hasan Sahih."" Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.) meaning, Allah will execute His decisions and judgement that He made for him, in whatever way He wills and chooses,</p><p>قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً</p><p>(Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.)

5221,"<h2>The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses</h2><p>Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. see 2:228 The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying;</p><p>وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ</p><p>(and for those who have no courses...) as for His saying;</p><p>إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ</p><p>(if you have doubt...) There are two opinions: First, is the saying of a group of the Salaf, like Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd. That is, if they see blood and there is doubt if it was menstrual blood or not. The second, is that if you do not know the ruling in this case, then know that their `Iddah is three months. This has been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr and it is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. And this is the more obvious meaning. Supporting this view is what is reported from Ubay bin Ka`b that he said, ""O Allah's Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur'an, the young, the old and the pregnant."" Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah,</p><p>وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ</p><p>(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, ""O Allah's Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur'an. There are the young, the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.' Later on, this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ</p><p>(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses.)""</p><h2>`Iddah of Pregnant Women</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ</p><p>(And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden;) Allah says: the pregnant woman's `Iddah ends when she gives birth, whether in the case of divorce or death of the husband, according to the agreement of the majority of scholars of the Salaf and later generations. This is based upon this honorable Ayah and what is mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Salamah said, ""A man came to Ibn `Abbas while Abu Hurayrah was sitting with him and said, `Give me your verdict regarding a lady who delivered a baby forty days after the death of her husband.' Ibn `Abbas said,` Her `Iddah period lasts until the end of the longest among the two prescribed periods.' I recited,</p><p>وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ</p><p>(For those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens;) Abu Hurayrah said, `I agree with my cousin (Abu Salamah).' Then Ibn `Abbas sent his slave Kurayb to Umm Salamah to ask her. She replied, `The husband of Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then she received a marriage proposal and Allah's Messenger ﷺ married her to somebody. Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed to her."" Al-Bukhari collected this short form of the Hadith, which Muslim and other scholars of Hadith collected using its longer form. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miswar bin Makhramah said, ""Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth to a child a few days after the death of her husband. When she finished the postdelivery term, she was proposed to. So she sought the permission of Allah's Messenger ﷺ for the marriage, and he permitted her to marry, so she got married."" Al-Bukhari collected this narration, as did Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah with a different chain of narration from the Hadith of Subay`ah. Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah said that his father wrote to `Umar bin `Abdullah bin Al-Arqam Az-Zuhri, requesting that he go to Subay`ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah to ask her about the matter in question, and about what Allah's Messenger ﷺ said to her when she sought his verdict. `Umar bin `Abdullah wrote to `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah informing him that Subay`ah told him that she had been married to Sa`d bin Khawlah, and he was one of those who participated in the battle of Badr. He died during the Farewell Pilgrimage, while she was pregnant. Soon after his death, she gave birth. When she passed the postnatal term, she beautified herself for those who might propose to her. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba`kak came to her and said, `Why do I see you have beautified yourself Do you wish to remarry By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days have passed."" Subay`ah said, ""When he said that, I dressed myself in the evening and went to Allah's Messenger ﷺ and asked him about his verdict. He gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry after I had given birth to my child, saying I could marry if I wish."" This is the narration that Muslim collected. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in a shorter form. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً</p><p>(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) means, Allah will make his matters lenient for him and will soon bring forth relief and a quick way out,</p><p>ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you;) meaning, this is His commandment and legislation that He sent down to you through His Messenger ,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً</p><p>(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.) means, Allah will prevent what he fears and multiply his reward even for the little good he does.</p>"

5223,"<h2>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</h2><p>Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her `Iddah period,</p><p>أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم</p><p>(Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you,</p><p>مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ</p><p>(according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to ""Your ability."" Qatadah said, ""If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.""</p><h2>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ</p><p>(and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, ""meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house."" Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha:</p><p>وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ</p><p>(and do not harm them in order to suppress them) ""He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.""</p><h2>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ</p><p>(And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not.</p><h2>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ</p><p>(Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant's well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ</p><p>(Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment,) Allah said,</p><p>وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ</p><p>(and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ</p><p>(No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child.) (2:233) Allah said,</p><p>وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى</p><p>(But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. Allah's statement,</p><p>لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ</p><p>(Let the rich man spend according to his means;) means, the wealthy father or his representative should spend on the child according to his means,</p><p>وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا</p><p>(and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.) This is as Allah said,</p><p>لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا</p><p>(Allah does not burden a person beyond what He can bear.) 2:286</p><h2>A Story of a Woman who had Taqwa</h2><p>Allah's statement;</p><p>سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً</p><p>(Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah's promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah's saying;</p><p>فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً - إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً</p><p>(Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) 94:5-6 There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, ""A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat' She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah's provisions.' He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.' She said, `Wait a little longer.' She was awaiting Allah's mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.' She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven's cover, so do not be hasty.' When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.' So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven."" Abu Hurayrah added, ""By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ )! This is the same statement that Muhammad ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْ أَخَذَتْ مَا فِي رَحْيَيْهَا وَلَمْ تَنْفُضْهَا (لَطَحَنَتْهَا) إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)""</p>"

He replied (to her),</p><p>«لَا، بَلْ شَرِبْتُ عَسَلًا عِنْدَ زَيْنَبَ بِنْتِ جَحْشٍ وَلَنْ أَعُودَ لَه»</p><p>(No, but I drank honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.)"" Then the following was revealed;</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ لِمَ تُحَرِّمُ مَآ أَحَلَّ اللَّهُ لَكَ</p><p>(O Prophet! Why do you fobid that which Allah has allowed to you) up to,</p><p>إِن تَتُوبَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ فَقَدْ صَغَتْ قُلُوبُكُمَا</p><p>(If you both turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined;) in reference to `A'ishah and Hafsah.</p><p>وَإِذَ أَسَرَّ النَّبِىُّ إِلَى بَعْضِ أَزْوَجِهِ حَدِيثاً</p><p>(And (remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives,) which refers to this saying,</p><p>«بَلْ شَرِبْتُ عَسَلًا»</p><p>(But I have drunk honey.) Ibrahim bin Musa said that Hisham said that it also meant his saying,</p><p>«وَلَنْ أَعُودَ لَهُ وَقَدْ حَلَفْتُ فَلَا تُخْبِرِي بِذَلِكِ أَحَدًا»</p><p>(I will not drink it anymore, I have taken an oath to that. Therefore, do not inform anybody about it.) Al-Bukhari also recorded this Hadith in the Book of Divorce; then he said, ""Al-Maghafir is a type of sap, and in Ar-Rimth (a type of citrus) its taste is sweet..."" Al-Jawhari said, ""The `Urfut is a tree of the shrub variety, which secretes Maghfur."" Muslim collected this Hadith from `A'ishah in the Book of Divorce in his Sahih, and his wording is the same as Al-Bukhari in the Book of Vows. In the Book of Divorce, Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, ""Allah's Messenger ﷺ liked sweets and honey. After performing the `Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives, going close to them. So he went to Hafsah, daughter of `Umar, and stayed with her more than his usual stay. I (`A'ishah) became jealous and asked about that. It was said to me, `A woman of her family sent her a small vessel of honey as a gift, and she gave a drink to Allah's Messenger ﷺ made from it.' I said, `By Allah, we will contrive a plot against him.' I said to Sawdah bint Zam`ah, `When the Messenger visits you and draws close to you, say to him, `Have you eaten Maghafir' And when he says to you, `No', then ask him, `What is this odor' He will say to you, `Hafsah has given me a drink of honey.' Then you should say to him, `The honeybees might have eaten from Urfut, and I will also say the same to him. Safiyyah, you should also say this.' Sawdah later said, `It was under compulsion that I had decided to state that which you told me; soon, by Allah, he was standing at my door.' So when Allah's Messenger ﷺ came near her, she said, `O Messenger of Allah! Did you eat Maghafir' He said, `No.' She again said, `Then what is this odor' He said,</p><p>«سَقَتْنِي حَفْصَةُ شَرْبَةَ عَسَل»</p><p>(Hafsah gave me honey to drink.) She said, `The honeybees might have eaten from `Urfut.')"" `A'ishah continued, ""When he came to me I said the same to him. He then visited Safiyyah and she also said similar to him. When he again visited Hafsah, she said, `O Messenger of Allah, should I not give you that (drink)' He said,</p><p>«لَا حَاجَةَ لِي فِيه»</p><p>(I do not need it.) Sawdah said, `By Allah! We have prevented him from drinking honey.' I said to her, `Keep quiet!""' Muslim also recorded this Hadith, but this wording is from Al-Bukhari. In the narration of Muslim, `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to hate to have a bad odor coming from him"" This is why they suggested to him that he ate Maghafir, because it causes a bad odor. When he said,</p><p>«بَلْ شَرِبْتُ عَسَلًا»</p><p>(No, I had some honey.) They said that the bees ate from a tree that is called Al-`Urfut, which has Maghafir gum, suggesting that this is the reason behind the bad odor they claimed was coming from him. The latter narration, collected through `Urwah from `A'ishah, mentions that it was Hafsah who gave the Prophet the honey. In another narration collected from `Ubayd bin `Umayr, from `A'ishah, it was Zaynab bint Jahsh who gave the honey to the Prophet , while `A'ishah and Hafsah were the plotters. Allah knows best. Some might say that they were two separate incidents. However, it is not likely that the Ayat were revealed about both incidents, if indeed they were two separate incidents. Allah knows best. A Hadith that Imam Ahmad collected in the Musnad mentions that `A'ishah and Hafsah were the plotters. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""I was eager to ask `Umar about the two ladies among the wives of the Prophet , about whom Allah said,</p><p>إِن تَتُوبَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ فَقَدْ صَغَتْ قُلُوبُكُمَا</p><p>(If you two turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined;) Then I performed Hajj along with `Umar, and on our way back from Hajj he went aside (to relieve himself). I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he finished and returned, I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, `O Commander of the faithful! Who were the two ladies among the wives of the Prophet , to whom Allah said,</p><p>إِن تَتُوبَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ فَقَدْ صَغَتْ قُلُوبُكُمَا</p><p>(If you two turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined)' `Umar said, `I am astonished at your question, O Ibn `Abbas.""' - Az-Zuhri (a subnarrator) said that `Umar did not like the question, but he still answered it, saying that they were `A'ishah and Hafsah. ""Then `Umar went on relating the story and said, `We, the people of Quraysh, used to have authority over our women. But when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. At that time, I was residing at the house of Umayyah bin Zayd, in Al-`Awali. Once I got angry with my wife, and she talked back to me; I disliked her answering me back. She said, `Why do you dislike me talking back to you By Allah, the wives of the Prophet talk back to him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day, until nightfall.' Then I went to Hafsah and asked her, `Do you talk back to Allah's Messenger ﷺ ' She said, `Yes.' I asked, `Does any of you keep Allah's Messenger ﷺ angry all day long, until night' She replied, `Yes.' I said, `Whoever among you does this is a ruined, losing person! Doesn't she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of His Messenger and, thus, she will be ruined Don't ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ too many things, and don't retort him in any case. Demand from me whatever you like, and don't be tempted to imitate your neighbor, for she is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah's Messenger ﷺ than you.' He meant `A'ishah.</p><p>I, and an Ansari neighbor of mine used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the revelation and when he went, he used to do the same for me. In those days it was rumored that the Ghassan (tribe) were preparing their horses to invade us. My companion went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door. I came out to him. He said that a grave thing happened. I asked him, `What is it Have Ghassan come' He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, adding that Allah's Messenger ﷺ had divorced all his wives. I said, `Hafsah is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.' So I dressed myself and I performed the Subh prayer. I went to Hafsah and found her weeping. I asked her, `Has Allah's Messenger ﷺ divorced all of you' She replied, `I don't know. He is there alone in the upper room.' I went to the upper room and asked a black slave of the Prophet to ask for his permission to see me, and the boy went in and then came out saying, `I mentioned you to him and he remained silent.' I then went out and came to the Minbar and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So, I requested to the boy, `Will you get the permission for `Umar' He went in and then came out saying, `I mentioned you to him, but he did not reply.' So, I went to Minbar and sat with the people who were sitting by the Minbar, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the boy again and said, `Will you get the permission for `Umar' He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, he called me saying, `Allah's Messenger ﷺ has granted you permission.' So, I entered the Prophet's room, greeted him with the Salam and saw him lying on a mat without bedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet.</p><p>I said, `Have you divorced your wives, O Allah's Messenger' He raised his eyes to me and replied no. I said, `Allahu Akbar. O Allah's Messenger! We, the people of Quraysh used to have the upper hand over our women. But when we came to Al-Madinah, we found a people whose women had the upper hand over them. Our women started learning this behavior from them. Once, I got angry with my wife, and she talked back to me. I disliked that behavior from her and she said, `Why do you dislike that I talk back to you By Allah, the Prophet's wives talk back to him and one of them would ignore him the whole day, until the night.' I said to her, `Whoever does this among them is the ruined loser! Does she feel safe from Allah getting angry with her on account of His Messenger's anger In that case, she would be ruined.' On that the Prophet smiled. I then said, `O Allah's Messenger! I went to Hafsah and said to her, `Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (`A'ishah) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I said, `Does the Messenger feel calm' He said, `Yes.' So, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see anything of importance, except three hides. I said, `Invoke Allah, O Allah's Messenger, to make your followers prosperous, for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, even though they do not worship Allah.' The Prophet sat upright and said,</p><p>«أَفِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(O Ibn Al-Khattab! Do you have any doubt These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.) I asked the Prophet , `Please beg Allah's forgiveness for me, O Allah's Messenger.' The Prophet swore that he would not go to his wives for one month, because of his severe anger towards them, until Allah the Exalted and Most Honored censured him."" Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith using various chains of narration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected it from Ibn `Abbas, who said, ""For a whole year, I was eager to ask `Umar bin Al-Khattab about an Ayah. However, I hesitated out of respect for him. Once, he went on a Hajj trip and I accompanied him. On our way back, he stopped to relieve himself behind some trees of Arak. I stopped until he finished and then walked along with him and asked him, `O Leader of the believers! Who are the two women who helped each other (or plotted) against the Prophet ""' This is the narration that Al-Bukhari collected, while Muslim recorded that Ibn `Abbas asked, ""Who are the two women about whom Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَإِن تَظَاهَرَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(but if you help one another against him, )"" `Umar replied, ""A'ishah and Hafsah."" Muslim mentioned the rest of the Hadith. Muslim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said to him, ""When Allah's Messenger ﷺ stayed away from his wives, I entered the Masjid and found people striking the ground with pebbles. They said, `Allah's Messenger ﷺ has divorced his wives.' That occurred before Hijab was commanded. I said to myself, `I must investigate this news today.""' So he mentioned the Hadith in which he went to `A'ishah and Hafsah and admonished them. He then said, `I went in and found Rabah, the servant of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, sitting on a window sill. I called, `O Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger ﷺ.""' He then mentioned the story as we mentioned above. `Umar continued, ""I said, `O Messenger of Allah, what trouble do you feel from your wives If you have divorced them, verily Allah is with you, His angels, Jibril, Mikal, I, Abu Bakr and the rest of believers are with you.' Often, when I talked, all praise is due to Allah, I hoped that Allah would testify to the words that I uttered. And so the Ayat of option was revealed. Allah said,</p><p>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ</p><p>(Maybe his Lord, if he divorces you, will give him in your place wives better than you,) and,</p><p>وَإِن تَظَاهَرَا عَلَيْهِ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ مَوْلَـهُ وَجِبْرِيلُ وَصَـلِحُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ ظَهِيرٌ</p><p>(but if you help one another against him, then verily, Allah is his Protector, and Jibril, and the righteous among the believers; and after that the angels are his helpers.) I said, `Messenger of Allah ﷺ, have you divorced them' He said, `No.' I stood at the door of the Masjid and called out at the top of my voice, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ has not divorced his wives.' It was on this occasion that this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الاٌّمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى أُوْلِى الاٌّمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنْبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(When any matter pertaining to peace or alarm comes to them, they broadcast it; whereas, if they would refer it to the Messenger and those who have been entrusted with authority among them, those of them who are engaged in obtaining intelligence would indeed know (what to do with) it.)(4:83) It was I who understood (and properly investigated) this matter."" Similar was said by Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ad-Dahhak and others. The Ayah,</p><p>وَصَـلِحُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(and the righteous among the believers;) refers to Abu Bakr and `Umar. Al-Hasan Al-Basri added `Uthman to them. Layth bin Abi Sulaym said from Mujahid:</p><p>وَصَـلِحُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(and the righteous among the believers;) includes `Ali bin Abi Talib also. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said, ""`Umar said, `The wives of the Prophet were all jealous for his affection, and I said to them,</p><p>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ</p><p>(Maybe his Lord, if he divorces you, will give him instead of you, wives better than you.) Thereafter, this Ayah was revealed.""' We mentioned before that `Umar said statements that were confirmed by the Qur'an, such as about the revelation about Hijab see 33:53 and the captive idolators after the battle of Badr see 8:67. `Umar's suggestion to take the Station of Ibrahim as a place for prayer and Allah revealed this Ayah;</p><p>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</p><p>(And take you the Maqam (station) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.) (2:125) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Anas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""I heard news that the Mothers of the faithful had a dispute with the Prophet . So I advised them, saying, `Either stop bothering Allah's Messenger ﷺ or Allah might provide him better wives than you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri added `Uthman to them.

Mujahid also commented on:</p><p>قُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً</p><p>(Protect yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)) saying, ""Have Taqwa of Allah and order your family to have Taqwa of Him."" Qatadah said, ""He commands obedience to Allah, to not disobey Allah, he orders his family to obey His orders and helps them to act upon His orders. When one sees disobedience, he stops them and forbids them from doing it."" Similar was said by Ad-Dahhak and Muqatil; ""It is an obligation for the Muslim to teach his near family members, and his male and female slaves what Allah has made obligatory for them and what Allah has forbidden for them."" There is a Hadith that confirms the meaning of this Ayah. Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ar-Rabi` bin Sabrah said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مُرُوا الصَّبِيَّ بِالصَّلَاةِ إِذَا بَلَغَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ، فَإِذَا بَلَغَ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ فَاضْرِبُوهُ عَلَيْهَا»</p><p>(Order the children to pray when they reach the age of seven and when they reach the age of ten, discipline them for (not performing) it.) This is the narration that Abu Dawud collected; At-Tirmidhi said, ""This Hadith is Hasan.""</p><h2>Fuel for Hell and a Description of its Angels</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p>(whose fuel is men and stones,) indicating that the Children of Adam will be fuel for the Fire that will feed it,</p><p>وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p>(and stones) in reference to the idols that were worshipped, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Mujahid, Abu Ja`far Al-Baqir and As-Suddi said that these are sulfur stones that are more putrid than rotten corpses, according to Mujahid. Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَيْهَا مَلَـئِكَةٌ غِلاَظٌ شِدَادٌ</p><p>(over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe,) means, their nature of behavior is stern, because the mercy has been taken out of their hearts for those who disbelieve in Allah,</p><p>شِدَادٌ</p><p>(severe) meaning, their structure is powerful, strong and frightening,</p><p>لاَّ يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</p><p>(who disobey not the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.) meaning, whatever Allah commands them, they rush to obey Him, without delay for even a twinkling of an eye. They are able to fulfill the command; they are called Az-Zabaniyah, meaning, the keepers and guards of Hell, may Allah give us shelter from them.</p><h2>No Excuse will be accepted from the Disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَعْتَذِرُواْ الْيَوْمَ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(O you who disbelieve! Make no excuses this Day! You are being requited only for what you used to do.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, the disbeliever will be told, ""Do not offer any excuse this Day, because it will not be accepted from you; you will only be recompensed for what you used to do. Today, you will receive the punishment for your actions.""</p><h2>Encouraging sincere Repentance</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ تُوبُواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَّصُوحاً</p><p>(O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance!) meaning, a true, firm repentance that erases the evil sins that preceded it and mend the shortcoming of the repenting person, encouraging and directing him to quit the evil that he used to do. Allah said,</p><p>عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُكَفِّرَ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَـتِكُمْ وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</p><p>(It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow) And when Allah says, ""it may be,"" it means He shall.</p><p>يَوْمَ لاَ يُخْزِى اللَّهُ النَّبِىَّ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ</p><p>(the Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not disgrace those who believed in the Prophet ,</p><p>نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَى بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِمْ</p><p>(Their light will run forward before them and in their right hands.) as we explained in Surat Al-Hadid,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(They will say:""Our Lord! Keep perfect our light for us and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things."") Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri and other said, ""This is the statement that the believers will say on the Day of Resurrection, when they witness the light of the hypocrites being extinguished."" Imam Ahmad recorded that a man from the tribe of Banu Kinanah said, ""I prayed behind the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during the year of the Conquest (of Makkah), and heard him say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ لَا تُخْزِنِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(O Allah!

However,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَخَانَتَاهُمَا</div><p>(they both betrayed them.) meaning, in the faith, they did not adhere to the faith sent through their husbands nor accepted their message.

Surely, the wives of the Prophets were immune from committing illegal sexual intercourse on account of the honor that Allah has granted His Prophets, as we explained in Surat An-Nur. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""They betrayed them by not following their religion. The wife of Prophet Nuh used to expose his secrets, informing his oppressive people whenever any person embraced the faith with Nuh. As for the wife of Prophet Lut, she used to inform the people of the city (Sodom), who committed the awful sexual act (sodomy), whenever a guest was entertained by her husband.""

(It is): (Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion.)) This Hadith was collected by At-Tirmidhi and the four Sunan Compilers. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, ""This is a Hasan Hadith."" At-Tabarani and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' Al-Maqdisi both recorded from Anas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«سُورَةٌ فِي الْقُرْآنِ خَاصَمَتْ عَنْ صَاحِبِهَا حَتْى أَدْخَلَتْهُ الْجَنَّةَ:</p><p>تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ»</p><p>(There is a chapter of the Qur'an that will argue on behalf of its reciter until it causes him to enter into Paradise. (It is): (Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion.))</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Glorification of Allah and mentioning the Creation of Death, Life, the Heavens and the Stars</h2><p>Allah the Exalted glorifies His Noble Self and informs that the dominion is in His Hand. This means that He deals with all of His creatures however He wishes and there is none who can reverse His decree. He is not questioned concerning what He does because of His force, His wisdom and His justice. For this reason Allah says,</p><p>وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(and He is Able to do all things.) Then Allah says,</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَوةَ</p><p>(Who has created death and life) Those who say that death is an existing creation use this Ayah as a proof because it is something that has been created. This Ayah means that He brought creation into existence from nothing in order to test the creatures. He examines them to see which of them will be best in deeds. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ</p><p>(How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life.) (2:28) In this Ayah Allah named the first stage, which is non-existence, ""death."" Then he named the origin or beginning of existence, ""life."" This is why Allah says,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ</p><p>(Then He will give death, then again will bring you to life ( on the Day of Resurrection)) (2:28). Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً</p><p>(He may test you which of you is best in deed.) it means best in deeds. This is as Muhammad bin `Ajlan said. It should be noted that Allah did not say ""which of you does the most deeds."" Allah then says,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ</p><p>(And He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving.) This means that He is the Almighty, the Most Great, the Most Powerful and the Most Honorable. However, along with this He is Most Forgiving to whoever turns to Him in repentance and seeks His pardon after having disobeyed Him and opposed His commandment. Even though Allah is Almighty, He also forgives, shows mercy, pardons and excuses. Then Allah says,</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقًا</p><p>(Who has created the seven heavens one above the other;) meaning stacked one on top of the other. Are they connected to each other, meaning that they are in elevated ascension, some of them being stacked above others, or separated with space between them There are two views concerning this, and the most correct opinion seems to be the latter as is proven in the Hadith of Isra' (the Prophet's Night Journey) and other narrations. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مَّا تَرَى فِى خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَـنِ مِن تَفَـوُتٍ</p><p>(you can see no fault in the creation of the Most Gracious.) means, it (the creation) is done in a flawless manner, and these are connected with each other so as to forms a straight level, having no disunion, conflict, inconsistency, deficiency, flaw or defect. This is the reason that Allah says,</p><p>فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَى مِن فُطُورٍ</p><p>(Then look again. Can you see any rifts) meaning, look at the sky and pay close attention to it. Do you see any flaw, deficiency, defect or rifts in it Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Ath-Thawri and others said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَى مِن فُطُورٍ</p><p>(Then look again. Can you see any rifts) that it means cracks. As-Suddi said that,</p><p>هَلْ تَرَى مِن فُطُورٍ</p><p>(Can you see any rifts) means any tears. Qatadah said,</p><p>هَلْ تَرَى مِن فُطُورٍ</p><p>(Can you see any rifts) means, `do you see any defects O Son of Adam (mankind)' In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُمَّ اْرجِعِ البَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ</p><p>(Then look again and yet again, ) Qatadah said, ""It means (look) twice.""</p><p>يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ البَصَرُ خَاسِئًا</p><p>(your sight will return to you Khasi',) Ibn `Abbas said that Khasi' means humiliated. Mujahid and Qatadah both said that it means despised.</p><p>وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ</p><p>(and worn out.) Ibn `Abbas said that this means it will be exhausted. Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi all said that it means broken down fatigue that comes from weakness. Thus, the Ayah means that if you continuously looked, no matter how much you look, your sight will return to you.</p><p>خَاسِئًا</p><p>(Khasi') due to the inability to see any flaw or defect (in Allah's creation).</p><p>وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ</p><p>(and worn out.) meaning, exhausted and broken down feebleness due to the great amount of repeated looking without being able to detect any deficiency. Then, after Allah negated any deficiency in the creation of the heavens, He explains their perfection and beauty. He says,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ</p><p>(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, ) This refers to the stars which have been placed in the heavens, some moving and some stationary. In Allah's statement,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَـطِينِ</p><p>(and We have made them (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin,) The pronoun `them' in His statement, ""and We have made them"" is the same type of statement as the stars being referred to as lamps. This does not mean that they are actually missiles, because the stars in the sky are not thrown. Rather, it is the meteors beneath them that are thrown and they are taken from the stars. And Allah knows best. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.) means, `We have made this disgrace for the devils in this life and We have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire in the Hereafter.' This is as Allah said in the beginning of Surat As-Saffat,</p><p>إِنَّا زَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِزِينَةٍ الْكَوَكِبِ - وَحِفْظاً مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّارِدٍ - لاَّ يَسَّمَّعُونَ إِلَى الْمَلإِ الاٌّعْلَى وَيُقْذَفُونَ مِن كُلِّ جَانِبٍ - دُحُوراً وَلَهُمْ عَذابٌ وَاصِبٌ - إِلاَّ مَنْ خَطِفَ الْخَطْفَةَ فَأَتْبَعَهُ شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ</p><p>(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.) 37:6-7 Qatadah said, ""These stars were only created for three purposes: Allah created them as adornment for the heaven (sky), as missiles for the devils and as signs for navigation. Therefore, whoever seeks to interpret any other meanings for them other than these, then verily he has spoken with his own opinion, he has lost his portion and burdened himself with that which he has no knowledge of."" Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this statement.</p>"

This means that this will be the worst end and a terrible destiny.</p><p>إِذَآ أُلْقُواْ فِيهَا سَمِعُواْ لَهَا شَهِيقًا</p><p>(When they are cast therein, they will hear its Shahiq) Ibn Jarir said, ""This means the sound of shouting.""</p><p>وَهِىَ تَفُورُ</p><p>(while it is simmering.) Ath-Thawri said, ""It will boil them just as a small number of seeds are boiled in a lot of water."" Then Allah says,</p><p>تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ</p><p>(It almost bursts up with fury.) meaning, some parts of it almost break apart from other parts due to the severity of its rage and anger with them.</p><p>تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ كُلَّمَا أُلْقِىَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ - قَالُواْ بَلَى قَدْ جَآءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ فِى ضَلَـلٍ كَبِيرٍ</p><p>(Every time a group is cast therein, its keepers will ask: ""Did no warner come to you"" They will say: ""Yes, indeed a warner did come to us, but we rejected him and said: `Allah never sent down anything; you are only in great error.""') In these Ayat Allah reminds of His justice in dealing with His creatures and that He does not punish anyone until the proof has been established against them and a Messenger has been sent to them. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً</p><p>(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.) 17:15 Allah also says,</p><p>حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوهَا فُتِحَتْ أَبْوَبُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّكُمْ وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَـآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَا قَالُواْ بَلَى وَلَـكِنْ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ الْعَذَابِ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ</p><p>(till when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. And its keepers will say, ""Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, reciting to you the Ayat of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours"" They will say: ""Yes,"" but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!"") 39:71 Thus, they have no recourse but to blame themselves and they will feel remorseful when such remorse will be of no benefit to them. They will say,</p><p>لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِى أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!) meaning, `if we would have benefited from our intellects or listened to the truth that Allah revealed, we would not have been disbelieving in Allah and misguided about Him. But we did not have understanding to comprehend what the Messengers came with, and we did not have the intelligence to guide us to following them.' Allah then says,</p><p>فَاعْتَرَفُواْ بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًا لاًّصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ</p><p>(Then they will confess their sin. So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire!) Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Al-Bakhtari At-Ta'i that he heard from one of the Companions that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَنْ يَهْلِكَ النَّاسُ حَتْى يُعْذِرُوا مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِم»</p><p>(The people will not be destroyed until they themselves confess their guilt.)</p>"

This has been dis- cussed at length previously and there is no need to repeat it here.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Pen Concerning</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْقَلَمِ</p><p>(By the pen) The apparent meaning is that this refers to the actual pen that is used to write. This is like Allah's saying,</p><p>اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ</p><p>(Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:3-5) Therefore, this statement is Allah's swearing and alerting His creatures to what He has favored them with by teaching them the skill of writing, through which knowledge is attained. Thus, Allah continues by saying,</p><p>وَمَا يَسْطُرُونَ</p><p>(and by what they Yastur.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said that this means, ""what they write."" As-Suddi said, ""The angels and the deeds of the servants they record."" Others said, ""Rather, what is meant here is the pen which Allah caused to write the decree when He wrote the decrees of all creation, and this took place fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth."" For this, they present Hadiths that have been reported about the Pen. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Al-Walid bin `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he said, ""My father called for me when he was dying and he said to me: `Verily, I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ فَقَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا أَكْتُبُ؟ قَالَ: اكْتُبِ الْقَدَرَ وَمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى الْأَبَد»</p><p>(Verily, the first of what Allah created was the Pen, and He said to it: ""Write."" The Pen said: ""O my Lord, what shall I write"" He said: ""Write the decree and whatever will throughout eternity."")"" This Hadith has been recorded by Imam Ahmad through various routes of transmission. At-Tirmidhi also recorded it from a Hadith of Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi and he (At-Tirmidhi) said about it, ""Hasan Sahih, Gharib.""</p><h2>Swearing by the Pen refers to the Greatness of the Prophet</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ</p><p>(You, by the grace of your Lord, are not insane.) meaning -- and all praise is due to Allah -- `you are not crazy as the ignorant among your people claim. They are those who deny the guidance and the clear truth that you have come with. Therefore, they attribute madness to you because of it.'</p><p>وَإِنَّ لَكَ لاّجْراً غَيْرَ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(And verily, for you will be reward that is not Mamnun.) meaning, `for you is the great reward, and abundant blessings which will never be cut off or perish, because you conveyed the Message of your Lord to creation, and you were patient with their abuse.' The meaning of:</p><p>غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(not Mamnun) is that it will not be cut off. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</p><p>(a gift without an end.) (11:108) and His statement,</p><p>فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(Then they shall have a reward without end.) (95:6) Mujahid said,</p><p>غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p>(Without Mamnun) means ""Without reckoning."" And this refers back to what we have said before.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Statement: ""Verily, You are on an Exalted Character.""</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""Verily, you are on a great religion, and it is Islam."" Likewise said Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd also said this. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) ""It has been mentioned to us that Sa`d bin Hisham asked `A'ishah about the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so she replied: `Have you not read the Qur'an' Sa`d said: `Of course.' Then she said: `Verily, the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was the Qur'an.""' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded similar to this and Imam Muslim recorded it in his Sahih on the authority of Qatadah in its full length. This means that he would act according to the commands and the prohibition in the Qur'an. His nature and character were patterned according to the Qur'an, and he abandoned his natural disposition (i.e., the carnal nature). So whatever the Qur'an commanded, he did it, and whatever it forbade, he avoided it. Along with this, Allah gave him the exalted character, which included the qualities of modesty, kindness, bravery, pardoning, gentleness and every other good characteristic. This is like that which has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, ""I served the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me (Uff), nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: `Why did you do that' And he never said to me concerning something I had not done: `Why didn't you do this' He had the best character, and I never touched any silk or anything else that was softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. And I never smelled any musk or perfume that had a better fragrance than the sweat of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."" Imam Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ had the most handsome face of all the people, and he had the best behavior of all of the people. And he was not tall, nor was he short."" The Hadiths concerning this matter are numerous. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi has a complete book on this subject called Kitab Ash-Shama'il. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ never struck a servant of his with his hand, nor did he ever hit a woman. He never hit anything with his hand, except for when he was fighting Jihad in the cause of Allah. And he was never given the option between two things except that the most beloved of the two to him was the easiest of them, as long as it did not involve sin. If it did involve sin, then he stayed farther away from sin than any of the people. He would not avenge himself concerning anything that was done to him, except if the limits of Allah were transgressed. Then, in that case he would avenge for the sake of Allah."" Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ صَالِحَ الْأَخْلَاق»</p><p>(I have only been sent to perfect righteous behavior.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>فَسَتُبْصِرُ وَيُبْصِرُونَ - بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ</p><p>(You will see, and they will see, which of you is afflicted with madness.) then it means, `you will know, O Muhammad -- and those who oppose you and reject you, will know -- who is insane and misguided among you.' This is like Allah's statement,</p><p>سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ</p><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!) (54:26) Allah also says,</p><p>وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًى أَوْ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And verily (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error.) (34:24) Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn `Abbas, it means ""You will know and they will know on the Day of Judgement."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ</p><p>(Which of you is Maftun (afflicted with madness) means which of you is crazy. This was also said by Mujahid and others as well. The literal meaning of Maftun is one who has been charmed or lured away from the truth and has strayed from it. Thus, the entire statement means, `so you will know and they will know,' or `you will be informed and they will be informed, as to which of you is afflicted with madness.' And Allah knows best. Then Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ</p><p>(Verily, your Lord is the best Knower of him who has gone astray from His path, and He is the best Knower of those who are guided.) meaning, `He knows which of the two groups are truly guided among you, and He knows the party that is astray from the truth.'</p>"

""This means that you should be quiet about their gods and abandon the truth that you are upon."" Then Allah says,</p><p>وَلاَ تُطِعْ كُلَّ حَلاَّفٍ مَّهِينٍ</p><p>(And do not obey every Hallaf (one who swears much) Mahin (liar or worthless person).) This is because the liar, due to his weakness and his disgracefulness, only seeks protection in his false oaths which he boldly swears to while using Allah's Names, and he uses them (false oaths) all the time and out of place (i.e., unnecessarily). Ibn `Abbas said, ""Al-Mahin means the liar."" Then Allah says,</p><p>هَمَّازٍ</p><p>(A Hammaz, ) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah both said, ""This is slander.""</p><p>مَّشَّآءِ بِنَمِيمٍ</p><p>(going about with Namim,) This refers to the one who goes around among people instigating discord between them and carrying tales in order to corrupt relations between people when they are good and pleasant. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Mujahid reported from Tawus that Ibn `Abbas said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ once passed by two graves and he said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُمَا لَيُعَذَّبَانِ وَمَا يُعَذَّبَانِ فِي كَبِيرٍ، أَمَّا أَحَدُهُمَا فَكَانَ لَا يَسْتَتِرُ مِنَ الْبَوْلِ، وَأَمَّا الْاخَرُ فَكَانَ يَمْشِي بِالنَّمِيمَة»</p><p>(Verily, these two are being punished, and they are not being punished for something major. One of them was not careful about protecting himself from urine (when relieving himself). The other one used to spread Namimah.)"" This Hadith has been recorded by the Group in their books through routes of transmission that are all on the authority of Mujahid. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah said, ""I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«لَا يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ قَتَّات»</p><p>(The slanderer will not enter into Paradise.)"" This Hadith has been reported by the Group except for Ibn Majah. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مَّنَّاعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Hinderer of good, transgressor, sinful,) it means, he refuses to give and withholds that which he has of good.</p><p>مُعْتَدٍ</p><p>(transgressor,) this means, in attaining that which Allah has made permissible for him, he exceeds the legislated bounds.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(sinful,) meaning, he delves into the forbidden things. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>عُتُلٍّ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ زَنِيمٍ</p><p>(`Utul, and moreover Zanim.) `Utul means one who is cruel, harsh, strong, greedy and stingy. Imam Ahmad recorded from Al-Harithah bin Wahb that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ؟ كُلُّ ضَعِيفٍ مُتَضَعِّفٍ لَوْ أَقْسَمَ عَلَى اللهِ لَأَبَرَّهُ. أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَهْلِ النَّارِ؟ كُلُّ عُتُلَ جَوَّاظٍ مُسْتَكْبِر»</p><p>(Shall I inform you of the people of Paradise (They will be) every weak and oppressed person. When he swears by Allah, he fulfills his oath. Shall I inform you of the people of the Fire Every `Utul (cruel person), Jawwaz and arrogant person.) Al-Waki` said, ""It (`Utul) is every Jawwaz, Ja`zari and arrogant person."" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this in their Two Sahihs, as well as the rest of the Group, except for Abu Dawud. All of its routes of transmission are by way of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah who both reported it from Sa`id bin Khalid. The scholars of Arabic language have said that Ja`zari means rude and harsh, while Jawwaz means greedy and stingy. Concerning the word Zanim, Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>عُتُلٍّ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ زَنِيمٍ</p><p>(`Utul (cruel), and moreover Zanim.) ""A man from the Quraysh who stands out among them like the sheep that has had a piece of its ear cut off."" The meaning of this is that he is famous for his evil just as a sheep that has a piece of its ear cut off stands out among its sister sheep. In the Arabic language the Zanim is a person who is adopted among a group of people (i.e., he is not truly of them). Ibn Jarir and others among the Imams have said this. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>أَن كَانَ ذَا مَالٍ وَبَنِينَ - إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا قَالَ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>((He was so) because he had wealth and children. When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: ""Tales of the men of old!"") Allah is saying, `this is how he responds to the favors that Allah has bestowed upon him of wealth and children, by disbelieving in Allah's Ayat and turning away from them while claiming that they are a lie that has been taken from the tales of the ancients.' This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً - وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ مَالاً مَّمْدُوداً - وَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً - وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً - ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً - سَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً - إِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ - فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ نَظَرَ - ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ - ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ - فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ - إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ - سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ - لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ - لَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ - عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ</p><p>(Leave Me alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely (without any wealth and children etc.). And then granted him resources in abundance. And children to be by his side. And made life smooth and comfortable for him. After all that he desires that I should give more. Nay! Verily, he has been opposing Our Ayat. I shall oblige him to face a severe torment! Verily, he thought and plotted. So let him be cursed, how he plotted! And once more let him be cursed, how he plotted! Then he thought. Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way. Then he turned back, and was proud. Then he said: ""This is nothing but magic from that of old, this is nothing but the word of a human being!"" I will cast him into Hellfire. And what will make you know what Hellfire is It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburned)! Burning and blackening the skins! Over it are nineteen (angels as keepers of Hell).) 74:11-30 Then Allah said here,</p><p>سَنَسِمُهُ عَلَى الْخُرْطُومِ</p><p>(We shall brand him on the snout!) Ibn Jarir said, ""We will make his matter clear and evident so that they will know him and he will not be hidden from them, just as the branding mark on the snouts (of animals)."" Others have said,</p><p>سَنَسِمُهُ</p><p>(We shall brand him) This is the mark of the people of the Hell-fire; meaning, `We will blacken his face on the Day of Judgement,' and the face has been referred to here as snout.</p><p>إِنَّا بَلَوْنَـهُمْ كَمَا بَلَوْنَآ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ إِذْ أَقْسَمُواْ لَيَصْرِمُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ - وَلاَ يَسْتَثْنُونَ - فَطَافَ عَلَيْهَا طَآئِفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ - فَأَصْبَحَتْ كَالصَّرِيمِ - فَتَنَادَوْاْ مُصْبِحِينَ - أَنِ اغْدُواْ عَلَى حَرْثِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـرِمِينَ - فَانطَلَقُواْ وَهُمْ يَتَخَـفَتُونَ - أَن لاَّ يَدْخُلَنَّهَا الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّسْكِينٌ - وَغَدَوْاْ عَلَى حَرْدٍ قَـدِرِينَ - فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهَا قَالُواْ إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ قَالَ أَوْسَطُهُمْ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ لَوْلاَ تُسَبِّحُونَ</p>"

5324,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Warning concerning the Greatness of the Day of Judgement</h2><p>Al-Haqqah is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, because during it the promise and the threat will inevitably occur. Due to this, Allah has declared the greatness of this matter. So He says,</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْحَاقَّةُ</p><p>(And what will make you know what Al-Haqqah is)</p><h2>Mention of the Destruction of the Nations</h2><p>Then Allah mentions the destruction of the nations that denied the Resurrection. He says,</p><p>فَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَأُهْلِكُواْ بِالطَّاغِيَةِ</p><p>(As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the Taghiyah!) It is the cry which will silence them, and the quake that will silence them. Qatadah said similar to this when he said, ""At-Taghiyah is the shout."" Mujahid said, ""At-Taghiyah means the sins."" This was also said by Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and bin Zayd. They said that it means transgression. After mentioning this, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat as proof for his statement,</p><p>كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِطَغْوَاهَآ</p><p>(Thamud denied through their transgression.) Then Allah says,</p><p>وَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُواْ بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ</p><p>(And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a wind Sarsar) meaning, a cold wind. Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ath-Thawri all said about,</p><p>عَاتِيَةٍ</p><p>(`Atiyah) ""This means severe blowing of the wind."" Qatadah said, ""It blew fiercely upon them until it pierced their hearts."" Ad-Dahhak said,</p><p>صَرْصَرٍ</p><p>(Sarsar) ""This means cold, and</p><p>عَاتِيَةٍ</p><p>(`Atiyah) means, it blew fiercely upon them without any mercy or blessing."" `Ali and others said, ""It blew fiercely upon their stored harvest until it was brought out worthless.""</p><p>سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(Which Allah imposed on them) meaning, He made it overpower them.</p><p>سَبْعَ لَيَالٍ وَثَمَـنِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُوماً</p><p>(for seven nights and eight days Husum,) Husum means, complete, successive and unfortunately evil. Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ath-Thawri and others all said, ""Husum means in succession."" It has been reported that `Ikrimah and Ar-Rabi` bin Khuthaym both said, ""It means it was unfortunately evil upon them."" This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>فِى أَيَّامٍ نَّحِسَاتٍ</p><p>(in days of calamity) (41: 16) It has been said that it is that which people now call A`jaz (apparently used to mean evil devastation). It seems as though the people took this term from Allah's statement,</p><p>فَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَى كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ</p><p>(so that you could see the people lying toppled, as if they were A`jaz (trunks) of date palms, Khawiyah!) Ibn `Abbas said about,</p><p>خَاوِيَةٍ</p><p>(Khawiyah) ""It means ruined."" Others besides him said, ""It means dilapidated."" This means that the wind would cause one of them (palm tree) to hit the ground, and it will fall down dead on his head. Then his head would shatter and it would remain a lifeless corpse as if it were without branches, motionless. It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نُصِرْتُ بِالصَّبَا وَأُهْلِكَتْ عَادٌ بِالدَّبُور»</p><p>(I was helped by an easterly wind and the people of `Ad were destroyed by a westerly wind.)</p><p>فَهَلْ تَرَى لَهُم مِّن بَاقِيَةٍ</p><p>(Do you see any remnants of them) meaning, `do you find any one of them left or anyone who even attributes himself to being from them' Rather they are all gone, right down to the last of them, and Allah did not make for them any successors. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَجَآءَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَن قَبْلَهُ</p><p>(And Fir`awn and those before him committed (sin)) This has been recited with a Kasrah under the letter Qaf (in the word Qabalahu, as Qiblahu), which changes the meaning to those who were with him in his time, and they were his followers who were disbelieving Coptic people. Others recited it with a Fathah over the letter Qaf (as the word Qablahu), which means those nations before him who were similar to him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَـتِ</p><p>(the overthrown cities) those nations that rejected their Messengers.</p><p>بِالْخَاطِئَةِ</p><p>(committed Al-Khati'ah.) Al-Khati'ah means their rejection of what Allah revealed. Ar-Rabi` said,</p><p>بِالْخَاطِئَةِ</p><p>(committed Al-Khati'ah.) ""This means disobedience."" Mujahid said, ""They committed errors."" Thus, Allah says,</p><p>فَعَصَوْاْ رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, ) meaning they were all of the same type, they all denied the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who was sent to them. As Allah says,</p><p>كُلٌّ كَذَّبَ الرُّسُلَ فَحَقَّ وَعِيدِ</p><p>(Everyone of them denied the Messengers, so My threat took effect.) So whoever denies a Messenger, then verily, he denies all of the Messengers. This is as Allah says,</p><p>كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p>(The people of Nuh belied the Messengers)</p><p>كَذَّبَتْ عَادٌ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p>(`Ad belied the Messengers.)</p><p>كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p>(Thamud belied the Messengers.) However, only one Messenger came to every nation. Thus, Allah says here,</p><p>فَعَصَوْاْ رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَهُمْ أَخْذَةً رَّابِيَةً</p><p>(And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He seized them with a punishment that was Rabiyah.) Rabiyah means, great, severe and painful. Mujahid said, ""Rabiyah means severe."" As-Suddi said, ""It means destructive.""</p><h2>A Reminder about the Blessing of the Ship</h2><p>Then, Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ</p><p>(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits,) meaning, it rose up over its shores by the leave of Allah and it overcame all that existed. Ibn `Abbas and others said, ""The water rising beyond its boundary means it increased abundantly."" This happened due to the supplication of Nuh against his people when they denied him, opposed him and worshipped other than Allah. Therefore, Allah answered his supplication and the people of the earth were covered with the flood except for those who were with Nuh in the ship. Thus, are humans all from the loins of Nuh and his progeny. For this reason Allah reminds humanity of His blessing,</p><p>إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ</p><p>(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship.) meaning, a ship running along upon the surface of the water.</p><p>لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً</p><p>(That We might make it an admonition for you) The pronoun ""it"" here refers to the species of the object (ships) due to the general meaning alluding to this. Thus, the meaning is, `We caused its type of creation (ships) to remain (in the earth) for you, so that you ride upon the currents of the water in the seas. ' This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَلِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride; In order that you may mount on their backs, and then may remember the favor of your Lord when you mount thereon) (43:12,13) And Allah said,</p><p>وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ - وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(And an Ayah for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship. And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) (36:41,42) Qatadah said, ""Allah caused this ship to remain until the first people of this Ummah saw it."" However, the first view (that it refers to all ships in general) is the most apparent. Allah continues saying,</p><p>وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ</p><p>(and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.) meaning, that a receptive ear may understand and reflect upon this bounty. Ibn `Abbas said, ""This means an ear that is retentive and hearing."" Qatadah said,</p><p>أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ</p><p>(by the retaining ears.) means, ""An ear that Allah gives intelligence, so it benefits by what it hears from Allah's Book."" Ad-Dahhak said,</p><p>وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ</p><p>(and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.) (69:12) means, ""An ear that hears it and retains it, meaning the person who has sound hearing, and correct intellect."" And this is general concerning everyone who understands and retains.</p>"

It is as though it is saying, a questioner requested to hasten on the torment that is about to fall. It is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ وَلَن يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ</p><p>(And they ask you to hasten on the torment! And Allah fails not His promise.) (22:47) meaning, that its torment will occur and there is no avoiding it. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah,</p><p>سَأَلَ سَآئِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ</p><p>(A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall) ""That is the questioning of the disbelievers about the torment of Allah and it will occur to them."" Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid that he said concerning Allah's statement</p><p>سَأَلَ سَآئِلٌ</p><p>(A questioner asked), ""A person called out (requesting) for the torment that will occur in the Hereafter to happen."" Then he said, ""This is their saying,</p><p>اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(O Allah!

(8:32) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاقِعٍلِلْكَـفِرِينَ</p><p>(about to befall (Waqi`) upon the disbelievers,) means, it is waiting in preparation for the disbelievers. Ibn `Abbas said, ""Waqi` means coming.""</p><p>لَيْسَ لَهُ دَافِعٌ</p><p>(which non can avert) meaning, there is no one who can repel it if Allah wants it to happen.

Mujahid said, ""Lord of the ways of ascent means the ways of ascension into the heavens."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ</p><p>(The angels and the Ruh Ta`ruju to Him) `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar from Qatadah that Ta`ruju means to ascend. In reference to the Ruh, Abu Salih said, ""They are creatures from the creation of Allah that resemble humans but they are not humans."" It could be that here it means Jibril, and this is a way of connecting the specific to the general (other angels). It could also be referring to the name of the souls (Arwah) of the Children of Adam (humans). For verily, when they (the human souls) are taken at death, they are lifted up to the heavens just as the Hadith of Al-Bara' proves.</p><h2>The Meaning of ""a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ</p><p>(in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) This refers to the Day of Judgement. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ</p><p>(in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) ""It is the Day of Judgement."" The chain of narration of this report (to Ibn `Abbas) is authentic. Ath-Thawri reported from Simak bin Harb from `Ikrimah that he said concerning this verse, ""It is the Day of Judgement."" Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd both said the same. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah,</p><p>تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ</p><p>(The angels and the Ruh ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) ""It is the Day of Judgement that Allah has made to be the measure of fifty thousand years for the disbelievers. "" Many Hadiths have been reported with this same meaning. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu `Umar Al-Ghudani that he said, ""I was with Abu Hurayrah when a man from Bani `Amir bin Sa`sa`ah passed and it was said: `This man is the wealthiest man of Bani `Amir.' So Abu Hurayrah said, `Bring him back to me.' So they brought the man back to Abu Hurayrah. Then Abu Hurayrah said, `I have been informed that you are a man of great wealth.' The man from Bani `Amir replied, `Yes, by Allah. I have one hundred red-colored camels, one hundred brown-colored camels...' and so on he counted numerous colored camels, the races of the slaves and the types of fetters for his horses that he owned. So Abu Hurayrah said, `Beware of the hooves of the camels and the cloven hooves of the cattle.' He continued repeating that to him until the color of the man began to change. Then the man said, `O Abu Hurayrah what is this' Abu Hurayrah replied, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ كَانَتْ لَهُ إِبِلٌ لَا يُعْطِي حَقَّهَا فِي نَجْدَتِهَا وَرِسْلِهَا»</p><p>(Whoever has camels and does not give their due (Zakah) in their Najdah and their Risl...) We interrupted saying, `O Messenger of Allah!

Then, the man from Bani `Amir said, `What is the due of the camel, O Abu Hurayrah' Abu Hurayrah said, `It is that you give (in your Zakah payment) from your most valuable camels, that you lend a milking she-camel, that you lend your mount for riding, that you give the milk (to the people) for drinking, and you lend the male camel for breeding.""' This Hadith was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.</p><h2>A Different Version of this Hadith</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْ صَاحِبِ كَنْزٍ لَا يُؤَدِّي حَقَّهُ إِلَّا جُعِلَ صَفَائِحَ، يُحْمَى عَلَيْهَا فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، فَتُكْوَى بِهَا جَبْهَتُهُ وَجَنْبُهُ وَظَهْرُهُ، حَتْى يَحْكُمَ اللهُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِهِ فِي يَوْم كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِمَّا تَعُدُّونَ، ثُمَّ يَرَى سَبِيلَهُ إِمَّا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَإِمَّا إِلَى النَّار»</p><p>(There is not any owner of treasure who does not pay its due except that it will be made into heated metal plates and branded upon him in the fire of Hell. His forehead, side and back will be scorched with these metal plates. This will continue until Allah judges between His servants on a Day whose measure is fifty thousand years of what you count. Then he will see his path, either to Paradise or to the Fire.) Then he (Abu Hurayrah) mentions the rest of the Hadith about the sheep and camels just as mentioned before. In this narration (of Ahmad) the Prophet also added,</p><p>«الْخَيْلُ لِثَلَاثَةٍ: لِرَجُلٍ أَجْرٌ، وَلِرَجُلٍ سِتْرٌ، وَعَلَى رَجُلٍ وِزْر»</p><p>(The horse is for three (on the Day of Judgement): for one man it is a reward, for another man it is a shield (protection), and upon another man it is a burden.) And the Hadith continues. Muslim also recorded this Hadith in its entirety even though Al-Bukhari did not mention it. The intent behind mentioning this here is the Prophet's statement,</p><p>«حَتْى يَحْكُمَ اللهُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»</p><p>(Until Allah judges between His servants on a day whose measurement is fifty thousand years.)</p><h2>Instructing the Prophet to have Patience Then</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>فَاصْبِرْ صَبْراً جَمِيلاً</p><p>(So be patient, with a good patience.) meaning, `be patient, O Muhammad, with your people's rejection and their seeking to hasten the torment since they think it will not occur.' Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p>يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا الْحَقُّ</p><p>(Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the very truth.) (42:18) Thus, Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ يَرَوْنَهُ بَعِيداً</p><p>(Verily, they see it (the torment) afar off.) meaning, the happening of the torment and the establishment of the Hour (Day of Judgement). The disbelievers see this as something that is farfetched. The word ""Ba`id"" here means that which is impossible to occur.</p><p>وَنَرَاهُ قَرِيباً</p><p>(But We see it (quite) near.) meaning, the believers believe that its occurrence is near, even though its time of occurrence is unknown and no one knows when it will be except Allah. All of what is approaching then it is near and it will definitely happen.</p>"

Even the child that he had who was dearer to him than the last beat of his heart in the life of this world, he would wish to use the child as a ransom for himself against the torment of Allah on the Day of Judgement when he sees the horrors.

This was the custom of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They used to seek refuge with the greatest Jinn of a particular place so that no harm or evil would afflict them. Like one would do if he entered into the land of his enemies, in the vicinity of a great and powerful man, he would seek the protection and guardianship of that man. So when the Jinns saw that the humans were seeking refuge with them due to their fear of them, they increased them in Rahaq which means fear, terror and fright. They did this so that the people would be more afraid of them and seek refuge with them even more. As Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً</div><p>(but they increased them in Rahaq.) means, ""the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them."" As-Suddi said, ""A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.""' Qatadah said, ""When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that."" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `Ikrimah that he said, ""The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.' So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.'

5455,"<h2>The Jinns stealing Information from the Sky before the the Messenger ﷺ was sent and striking Them with flaming Fire after His Coming.</h2><p>Allah informs about the Jinns when He sent His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ and revealed the Qur'an to him. Among the ways He protected it (the Qur'an) was by filling sky with stern guards guarding it from all of its sides. The devils were then expelled from the places where they used to sit prior to that. This was so that they could not steal anything from the Qur'an and tell it to the soothsayers, thereby causing matters to be confused and mixed up. If this happened it would not be known who was being truthful. Allah did this out of His kindness to His creation, His mercy upon His servants and His protection of His Mighty Book (the Qur'an). This is why the Jinns said,</p><p>وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا السَّمَآءَ فَوَجَدْنَـهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَساً شَدِيداً وَشُهُباً - وَأَنَّا كُنَّا نَقْعُدُ مِنْهَا مَقَـعِدَ لِلسَّمْعِ فَمَن يَسْتَمِعِ الاٌّنَ يَجِدْ لَهُ شِهَاباً رَّصَداً</p><p>(And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires. And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush.) meaning, whoever would like to steal some information by listening, he will find a flaming fire waiting in ambush for him. It will not pass him or miss him, but it will wipe him out and destroy him completely.</p><p>وَأَنَّا لاَ نَدْرِى أَشَرٌّ أُرِيدَ بِمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَمْ أَرَادَ بِهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ رَشَداً</p><p>(And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance.) meaning, `we do not know if this -- the matter which has occurred in the sky -- is intended for those who are in the earth or if their Lord intends some guidance for them.' They stated this in such a manner out of their etiquette in phrasing their speech, because they did not attribute the doing of evil to anyone and they attributed the good to Allah. Verily, it has been recorded in the Sahih,</p><p>«وَالشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْك»</p><p>(And evil is not attributed to You (Allah).) It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this, however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. As was reported in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas when he said, ""While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ a shooting star flashed in the sky. So the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَا كُنْتُمْ تَقُولُونَ فِي هَذَا؟»</p><p>(What did you all used to say about this) We replied, ""We used to say that a great person has been born and a great person has died."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ كَذَلِكَ، وَلَكِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا قَضَى الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(This is not so, rather whenever Allah decrees a matter in the heaven...)"" and then he went on to narrate the rest of the Hadith which we have already mentioned in its entirety in Surah Saba'. This is what caused them to seek the reason for this occurrence. So they set out searching in the east and the west. Then they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting (the Qur'an) while leading his Companions in prayer. Thus, they knew that this Qur'an was the reason for the sky being guarded. Therefore, some among them believed in it and the others became more rebellious in their transgression. A discussion of this has preceded in a Hadith of Ibn `Abbas concerning Allah's statement in Surat Al-Ahqaf,</p><p>وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ</p><p>(And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad ﷺ) a group of the Jinn (quietly) listening to the Qur'an.) (46:29) There is no doubt that when so many shooting stars began appearing in the sky, it horrified humans and Jinns alike. They were very disturbed and alarmed by it. They thought that it was the destruction of the world. As-Suddi said, ""The sky was never guarded except if there was a Prophet in the earth or the religion of Allah was victorious and dominant in the earth."" So the devils before the time of Muhammad ﷺ had taken sitting stations for themselves in the heaven of this world and they would listen to the matters that occurred in the heaven. But when Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ as a Prophet and Messenger, they were suddenly pelted one night (with the flaming, shooting stars). So the people of Ta'if were frightened because of this and they began to say, `The dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.' This was because they saw the severe fires in the sky and the shooting flames. They began freeing their servants and abandoning their luxuries. So `Abd Yalayl bin `Amr bin `Umayr said to them and he was referred to for judgement among them ""Woe to you O people of Ta'if! Hold on to your wealth and look at these guiding stars in the sky.If you see them remaining in their place, then the dwellers of the sky have not been destroyed, rather this has happened because of Ibn Abi Kabshah (-- meaning Muhammad ﷺ). And if you look and see that you can no longer see these stars, then verily the dwellers of the sky have been destroyed."" So, they looked and saw that the stars still remained, and thus, they kept their wealth. The devils also were frightened during that night. They went to Iblis and informed him of what happened to them. So he (Iblis) said, ""Bring me a handful of dirt from every land so that I may smell it."" So they brought it and he smelled it and said, ""It is your friend in Makkah."" Then he sent a group of seven Jinns to Makkah, and they found the Prophet of Allah standing in prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram while reciting the Qur'an. They drew near to him eager to hear the Qur'an, until their chests almost pressed against him. Then they accepted Islam and Allah revealed their matter to His Messenger . We have mentioned this chapter in its entirety in the first section of the Kitab As-Sirah with lengthy discussion. Allah knows best and unto Him is all praise and blessings.</p>"

He commands him to get up and stand in prayer to His Lord. This is as Allah says,</p><p>تَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend out of what We have bestowed on them.) (32:16) Thus, the Prophet did as Allah ordered him, by standing for prayer at night. This was obligatory upon him alone, as Allah said,</p><p>وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَى أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُودًا</p><p>(And in some parts of the night offer the Salah with it (the Qur'an), as an additional prayer for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.) (17:79) Here Allah explains how much prayer he should perform. Allah says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُزَّمِّلُ - قُمِ الَّيْلَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً</p><p>(O you wrapped up! Stand all night, except a little.) Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi all said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُزَّمِّلُ</p><p>(O you wrapped up!) ""This means, O you who are asleep."" Qatadah said, ""The one who is wrapped up in his garments."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>نِّصْفَهُ</p><p>(Half of it) means, instead of the whole night.</p><p>أَوِ انقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلاًأَوْ زِدْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(A little less than that, or a little more.) meaning, `We have commanded you to stand in prayer for half of the night, either a little more than it or a little less.

This is how the Prophet used to recite. `A'ishah said, ""He (the Prophet) used to recite the chapter slowly, so much so that it would be longer than chapters that were actually longer than it."" In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded from Anas that he was asked about the recitation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , so he replied, ""He used to elongate the letters."" Then he (Anas) recited,</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) (1:1) and he elongated ""In the Name of Allah,"" and he elongated ""The Most Gracious,"" and he elongated ""The Most Merciful."" Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn Abi Mulaykah, who narrated from Umm Salamah that she was asked about the recitation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , so she said, ""He used to pause in his recitation, verse by verse.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praise is Allah's, the Lord of all that exists. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Only Owner of the Day of Recompense.) (1:1-4) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. We have already mentioned the Hadiths which prove the recommendation of slow rhythmic recitation and beautification of the voice while reciting at the beginning of this Tafsir. For example, the Hadith which states,</p><p>«زَيِّنُوا الْقُرْآنَ بِأَصْوَاتِكُم»</p><p>(Beautify the Qur'an with your voices.) and the Hadith,</p><p>«لَيْسَ مِنَّا مَنْ لَمْ يَتَغَنَّ بِالْقُرْآن»</p><p>(He is not of us who does not chant nicely with the recitation of the Qur'an.) and the Hadith,</p><p>«لَقَدْ أُوتِيَ هَذَا مِزْمَارًا مِنْ مَزَامِيرِ آلِ دَاوُد»</p><p>(Verily, he has been given this windpipe from the windpipes of the family of Dawud.)

Stop at its amazing parts and make your heart move with it. None of you should let his concern be to reach the end of the chapter."" This has been recorded by Al-Baghawi. Al-Bukhari recorded from Abi Wa'il that he said, ""A man came to Ibn Mas`ud and said, `I read the Mufassal chapters (from Qaf to An-Nas) last night in one unit of prayer.'

Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said, ""The actions with it."" It has also been said that it means it will be heavy at the time of its revelation due to its magnificence. This is similar to what Zayd bin Thabit said. He said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ received some revelation while his thigh was on top of my thigh, and my thigh was almost crushed due to it."" Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr that he said, ""I asked the Prophet , `O Messenger of Allah! Do you feel anything when revelation comes (to you)' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied,</p><p>«أَسْمَعُ صَلَاصِلَ ثُمَّ أَسْكُتُ عِنْدَ ذَلِكَ، فَمَا مِنْ مَرَّةٍ يُوحَى إِلَيَّ إِلَّا ظَنَنْتُ أَنَّ نَفْسِي تُقْبَض»</p><p>(I hear a ringing and then I remain quiet when that occurs. There has not been a single time that revelation has come to me except that I thought that my soul was about to be taken (death).)"" Ahmad was alone in narrating this. In the beginning of Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded from `A'ishah that Al-Harith bin Hisham asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, ""How does the revelation come to you"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«أَحْيَانًا يَأْتِي فِي مِثْلِ صَلْصَلَةِ الْجَرَسِ وَهُوَ أَشَدُّهُ عَلَيَّ، فَيُفْصَمُ عَنِّي وَقَدْ وَعَيْتُ عَنْهُ مَا قَالَ، وَأَحْيَانًا يَتَمَثَّلُ لِي الْمَلَكُ رَجُلًا فَيُكَلِّمُنِي فَأَعِي مَا يَقُول»</p><p>(Sometimes it comes to me like the ringing of a bell, and it is most severe upon me. Then this state passes away from me after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.) `A'ishah added, ""Verily, I saw him receiving revelation and I noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead on a very cold day as the revelation ended."" This is the wording recorded by Al-Bukhari. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that she said, ""If the Messenger of Allah ﷺ received any revelation while he was on his riding animal, it would begin moving its Jiran intensely."" The Jiran is the bottom of the neck. Ibn Jarir chose the interpretation that it (the revelation) is heavy in both ways simultaneously. This is as `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, ""Just as it is heavy in this world, it will also be heavy on the Day of Judgement in the Scales.""</p><h2>The Virtue of standing at Night for Prayer</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ نَاشِئَةَ الَّيْلِ هِىَ أَشَدُّ وَطْأً وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلاً</p><p>(Verily, rising (Nashi'ah) at night is better for understanding and more suitable for speech (recitation).) `Umar, Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Zubayr, all said, ""The entire night is Nashi'ah."" Mujahid and others said the same. It is said ""Nasha'a"" when a person stands at night to pray. In one narration from Mujahid he said, ""(It is) after `Isha' (prayer)."" This was also said by Abu Mijlaz, Qatadah, Salim, Abu Hazim and Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir. The point is that Nashi'ah of the night refers to its hours and its times, every hour of it is called Nashi'ah, so it refers to the periods of time. The purpose of this is that standing at night (for prayer) is better for training the heart and the tongue, and more conducive to recitation. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>هِىَ أَشَدُّ وَطْأً وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلاً</p><p>(is better for understanding and more suitable for speech (recitation).) meaning, more comprehensive for the matter of performing the recitation and better for understanding it than in the recitation of the day. This is because the daytime is the time for people to disperse and move about, to raise voices and be lively. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili said, ""Ibrahim bin Sa`id Al-Jawhari told us that Abu Usamah told us that Al-A`mash informed us that Anas bin Malik recited this Ayah as: (إِنَّ نَاشِئَةَ اللَّيْلِ هِيَ أَشَدُّ وَأَصْوَبُ قِيلًا) (`Verily, rising at night is better for understanding and more correct for the speech.') So a man said to him, `We recite it;</p><p>وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلاً</p><p>(more suitable for speech).' So Anas said to him, `Most correct (Aswab), most suitable (Aqwam), the best for preparation (Ahya') and similar words are all the same (in meaning).""' Thus, Allah continues saying,</p><p>إِنَّ لَكَ فِى النَّهَارِ سَبْحَاً طَوِيلاً</p><p>(Verily, for you in the day is lengthy Sabh.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and ""Ata' bin Abi Muslim, all said, ""Leisure time and sleep."" Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Sufyan Ath-Thawri, all said, ""A long amount of leisure time."" Qatadah said, ""Leisure, aspirations and activities."" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said concerning the statement,</p><p>إِنَّ لَكَ فِى النَّهَارِ سَبْحَاً طَوِيلاً</p><p>(Verily, for you in the day is lengthy Sabh.) ""This means for your needs. Therefore, leave the night open for your religious devotion. Allah said this when the (voluntary) night prayer was obligatory. Then, Allah blessed His servants, lightened the matter and removed its obligation."" Then he recited,</p><p>قُمِ الَّيْلَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً</p><p>(Stand (to pray) all night, except a little.) to the end of the Ayah, then he recited,</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُومُ أَدْنَى مِن ثُلُثَىِ الَّيْلِ وَنِصْفَهُ</p><p>(Verily, your Lord knows that you do stand less than two- thirds of the night, or half of it.) (73:20) until he reached,</p><p>مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</p><p>(So recite of it what is easy.) (73:20) and Allah says,</p><p>وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَى أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُودًا</p><p>(And Tahajjud in some parts of the night (also offer the Salah with it), as an additional prayer for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.) (17:79) In fact, this is as true as what he (`Abdur-Rahman) said, The proof for this view is what Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad, that Sa`id bin Hisham divorced his wife and then traveled to Al-Madinah in order to sell some property he had with her. He intended to use its money to buy an animal and a weapon and then go for Jihad against the Romans until he died. In the process of this he met a group of his people and they informed him that a group of six men from his people had intended that in the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, upon which he said,</p><p>«أَلَيْسَ لَكُمْ فِيَّ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ؟»</p><p>(Is there not for you all an excellent example in me) So he forbade them from that and made them testify that they would take their wives back. Then he (Sa`id) returned to us and informed us that he went to Ibn `Abbas and asked him about the Witr (prayer). Ibn `Abbas said, ""Shall I not inform you of the person who is the most knowledgeable person on the earth about the Witr prayer of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ "" He said, ""Yes."" Ibn `Abbas then said, ""Go to `A'ishah and ask her, then return to me and inform me of what she tells you."" He said, ""Then I went to Hakim bin Aflah and requested him to go with me to her. But he said, `I do not want to be near her. Verily, I forbade her from saying anything concerning these two parties (the parties of `Ali and Mu`awiyah), but she refused and continued being involved with them (in their conflict).' So I adjured him by Allah, so he came with me and we entered upon her (in her house)."" So she said, ""Is this the Hakim that I know"" He (Hakim) said, ""Yes."" Then she said, ""Who is this that is with you"" He said, ""Sa`id bin Hisham."" She said, ""Who is Hisham"" He said, ""He is Ibn `Amir."" She then asked Allah to have mercy upon him (`Amir). Then she said, ""Yes, `Amir was a true man."" Then I (Sa`id) said, ""O Mother of the believers! Inform me about the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."" She replied, ""Have you not read the Qur'an"" I said, ""Of course."" Then she said, ""Verily, the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was the Qur'an."" I was about to stand and leave, but then I remembered to ask about the night prayer of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. I said, ""O Mother of the believers! Inform me about the night prayer of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."" She said, ""Have you not read the Surah,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُزَّمِّلُ</p><p>(O you wrapped up.) I said, ""Of course."" She then said, ""Verily, Allah made standing at night (for prayer) obligatory at the beginning of this Surah. So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his Companions stood for an entire year during the night (in prayer) until their feet swelled. Allah held back the revelation of the end of this Surah for twelve months. Then, Allah revealed the lightening of this burden at the end of this Surah. Then, the standing for night prayer became voluntary after it used to be obligatory."" I was about to leave when I remembered to ask her about the Witr prayer of the Messenger of Allah . So I said, ""O Mother of the believers! Inform me about the Witr prayer of the Messenger of Allah ."" She said, ""We used to prepare his Siwak (toothstick) for him and his ablution water, and Allah would awaken him whenever He wished to awaken him during the night. Then, he would clean his teeth with the Siwak and perform ablution. Then, he would pray eight (Rak`ahs) units of prayer and he would not sit during them except at the end of the eighth one. At this point he would sit and remember his Lord the Most High, and supplicate to Him. Afterwards he would stand without saying the greeting of peace (Taslim). He would then pray a ninth unit of prayer and then sit. He would remember Allah Alone and then supplicate to Him (during this sitting). Then, he would say the greetings of peace (to conclude the prayer) making it audible to us. Then, he would pray two more units of prayer after this salutation of peace, while he would be sitting. So these are eleven units of prayer, O my son. Then, when he became older and heavier, he would perform Witr prayer with seven units of prayer, and then he would pray two extra units of prayer after them while sitting after the salutation of peace. So these are nine units of prayer, O my son. Whenever the Messenger of Allah used to pray a particular prayer, he liked to remain consistent in its performance. If he would ever be preoccupied from performing the night prayer by oversleeping, pain or illness, he would pray twelve units of supererogatory prayer during the day. I do not know of Allah's Prophet ever reciting the entire Qur'an in one night before morning nor did he fast an entire month other than the month of Ramadan."" So I went to Ibn `Abbas and told him what she had said. Ibn `Abbas then said, ""She has spoken truthfully and if I had went to her house I would have remained until she spoke directly to me and I could see her lips moving."" This is how Imam Ahmad recorded this narration in its entirety. Muslim also recorded similarly in his Sahih. Ibn Jarir recorded from Abu `Abdur-Rahman that he said, ""When the Ayah</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُزَّمِّلُ</p><p>(O you wrapped.) (73:1) was revealed, the people stood in night prayer for an entire year until their feet and shins swelled. This continued until Allah revealed,</p><p>مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</p><p>(So recite of it what is easy.) (73:20) Then the people relaxed."" Al-Hasan Al-Basri and As-Suddi both said the same. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>قُمِ الَّيْلَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً - نِّصْفَهُ أَوِ انقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلاً</p><p>(Stand (to pray) all night, except a little. Half of it or less than that, a little.) (73:2,3) ""This became difficult on the believers. Then Allah lightened the matter for them and had mercy on them when He revealed after this,</p><p>أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُمْ مَّرْضَى وَءَاخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَءَاخَرُونَ</p><p>(He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty.) until Allah says,</p><p>مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</p><p>(So, recite you of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you.) (73:20) So Allah made the matter easy - and unto Him is due all praise - and he did not make matters difficult."" Then Allah says,</p><p>وَاذْكُرِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ وَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلاً</p><p>(And remember the Name of your Lord and (Tabattal) devote yourself to Him with complete devotion.) meaning, make much remembrance (Dhikr) of Him, devote yourself to Him and spend your time worshipping Him when you have completed your occupations and what you need from the affairs of your worldly matters. This is as Allah says,</p><p>فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَانصَبْ</p><p>(So when you have finished (your occupation), devote yourself for Allah's worship.) (94:7) meaning, when you have completed your tasks and occupations, then busy yourself in His obedience and His worship so that you will have free time for leisure. The meaning of this was said by Ibn Zayd, or close to its meaning. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Salih, `Atiyah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi, all said,</p><p>وَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلاً</p><p>(And (Tabattal) devote yourself to Him with complete devotion.) ""This means, make your worship solely for Him alone."" Al-Hasan said, ""Strive and devote yourself to Him."" Ibn Jarir said, ""A devout worshipper is called Mutabattil. An example of this is the reported Hadith that he (the Prophet ) forbade At-Tabattul, which means total devotion to worship while avoiding getting married."" Allah said,</p><p>رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً</p><p>(Lord of the east and the west; La ilaha illa Huwa. So take Him a trustee.) meaning, He is the Owner and Controller of affairs in the eastern regions and the western regions. He is the One except whom there is no deity worthy of worship. Just as you single Him out for worship, you should also single Him out for reliance. Therefore, take Him as a guardian and trustee. This is as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p>فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(So worship Him and rely upon him.) (11:123) It is also similar to His statement,</p><p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p>(You (Alone) we worship, and you (Alone) we ask for help.) (1:5) The Ayat with this meaning are numerous. They contain the command to make worship and acts of obedience exclusively for Allah, and to rely solely upon Him.</p>"

Thus, there will be no valleys and no hills.

Both of these meanings are good. However, the first interpretation is closer to the truth. And Allah knows best. The meaning of Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْماً يَجْعَلُ الْوِلْدَنَ شِيباً</div><p>(On a Day that will make the children gray-headed) is that this will happen due to the severity of its horrors, its earth- quakes and its distur- bing confusion.

5496,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The First Ayat to be revealed after `Read!</h2><p>It has been confirmed in the Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim on the authority of Abu Salamah that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ speaking about the time period (of the pause in) revelation. The Prophet said,</p><p>«فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي إِذْ سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاءَ، قَاعِدٌ عَلَى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ إِلَى أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي. فَأَنْزَلَ (اللهُ تَعَالى):</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ</p><p>فَاهْجُرْ</p><p>ثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»</p><p>(While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky and saw the same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'. He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him (in fear) until I fell down to the ground. Then, I went to my family and I said, `Wrap me up, wrap me up. So, they wrapped me up! So Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn!) until (And keep away) Here, Abu Salamah added, `Ar-Rujz means idols.' (After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this. This is due to the Prophet's statement,</p><p>«فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاء»</p><p>(The same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'.)"" That angel was Jibril, who had came to him with Allah's statement,</p><p>اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ - خَلَقَ الإِنسَـنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ - اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ</p><p>(Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created. He has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:1-5) After this first occurrence (in the cave) there was a period of time that passed, then the angel descended again. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«ثُمَّ فَتَرَ الْوَحْيُ عَنِّي فَتْرَةً، فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي، قَاعِدٌ عَلى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ فَرَقًا حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي، فَأَنْزَلَ اللهُ تَعَالى:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ</p><p>ثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»</p><p>(Then the revelation ceased coming to me for a period of time.Then, while I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky to see the same angel who had come to me, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him a short distance before I fell down to the ground. Then I came to my family and said to them, `Wrap me up, wrap me up! So, they wrapped me up! Then Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord. And purify your garments. And keep away from Ar-Rujz!)( After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith by way of Az-Zuhri. At-Tabarani recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""Verily, Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah prepared some food for the Quraysh. So when they had eaten from it he said, `What do you have to say about this man' Some of them said, `He is a magician.' Others said, `He is not a magician.' Then some of them said, `He is a soothsayer.' But others said, `He is not a soothsayer.' Some of them said, `He is a poet.' But others said, `He is not a poet.' Some of them said, `This is magic from that of old.' Thus, they eventually all agreed that it was magic from ancient times. Then, when this news reached the Prophet , he became grieved, covered his head and wrapped himself up. This is when Allah revealed,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ - وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ - وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ</p><p>(O you enveloped in garments! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord (Allah)! And purify your garments! And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)! And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of obedience to Allah as a favour to Him). And be patient for the sake of your Lord (i.e., perform your duty to Allah)!) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ</p><p>(Arise and warn!) means, prepare to go forth with zeal and warn the people. With this the Prophet attained messengership just as he attained prophethood with the first revelation.</p><p>وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ</p><p>(And magnify your Lord!) to declare the greatness of Him. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ</p><p>(And purify your garments!) ""This means, do not let your garments that you wear be from earnings that are unlawful."" It has also been said, ""Do not wear your clothes in disobedience."" Muhammad bin Sirin said,</p><p>وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ</p><p>(And purify your garments!) ""This means clean them with water."" Ibn Zayd said, ""The idolators would not clean themselves, so Allah commanded him to clean himself and his garments."" This view was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Sa`id bin Jubayr said,</p><p>وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ</p><p>(And purify your garments!) ""This means purify your heart and your intentions."" Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, ""And beautify your character."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ</p><p>(And keep away from Ar-Rujz!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""Ar-Rujz are idols, so keep away from them."" Similar to this was said by Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd, ""Verily, it is the idols."" This is like Allah's statement,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّبِىِّ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُطِعِ الْكَـفِرِينَ وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ</p><p>(O Prophet! have Taqwa of Allah, and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites.) (33:1) and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَالَ مُوسَى لاًّخِيهِ هَـرُونَ اخْلُفْنِى فِى قَوْمِى وَأَصْلِحْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</p><p>(And Musa said to his brother Harun: ""Replace me among my people, act well and follow not way of the corrupters."") (7:142) Then Allah says,</p><p>وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ</p><p>(And give not a thing in order to have more.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Do not give any gift seeking to get (back in return) more than it."" Khusayf reported from Mujahid;</p><p>وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ</p><p>(And give not a thing (Tamnun) in order to have more.) ""Do not slacken in seeking more good. Tamnun in the language of the Arabs means to become weak."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ</p><p>(And be patient for the sake of your Lord!) meaning, make your patience with their harms be for the Face of your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. This was stated by Mujahid. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, ""Be patient in your giving for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.""</p><h2>Reminding of the Day of Judgement</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ - فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ</p><p>(Then, when the Naqur is sounded. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the disbelievers) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Zayd bin Aslam, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd, all said,</p><p>النَّاقُورِ</p><p>(Naqur) ""It is the Trumpet."" Mujahid said, ""It is in the shape of a horn."" Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Ashaj told them that Asbat bin Muhammad related to them from Mutarrif, from `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, from Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ</p><p>(Then, when the Trumpet is sounded.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ يَنْتَظِرُ مَتَى يُؤْمَرُ فَيَنْفُخُ؟»</p><p>(How can I be comfortable when the one with the horn has placed it in his mouth, leaned his forehead forward, and is waiting to be commanded so that he can blow) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, ""What do you command us, O Messenger of Allah"" He replied,</p><p>«قُولُوا: حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ، عَلَى اللهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا»</p><p>(Say: ""Allah is sufficient for us, and what an excellent Trustee He is. We put our trust in Allah."") It has been recorded like this by Imam Ahmad on the authority of Asbat. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ</p><p>(Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day.) meaning, severe.</p><p>عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ</p><p>(Far from easy for the disbelievers.) meaning, it will not be easy for them. This is as Allah says,</p><p>يَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ</p><p>(The disbelievers will say: ""This a Hard Day."") (54:8) We have reported from Zurarah bin Awfa, the judge of Al-Basrah, that he lead the people in the morning prayer and he recited this Surah. Then, when he reached Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ - فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ</p><p>(Then, when the Naqur is sounded. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the disbelievers.) he made a moaning sound and then he fell down dead. May Allah have mercy on him.</p><p>ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً - وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ مَالاً مَّمْدُوداً - وَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً - وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً - ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً - سَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً - إِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ - فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ نَظَرَ - ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ - ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ - فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ - إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ - سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ - لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ</p>"

Here, what is being sworn about is the affirmation of the final abode and the refutation against the claim of the ignorant that the resurrection of bodies will not occur. This is why Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ - وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ </div><p>(Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) Qatadah said, ""This means, I swear by both of these things."" This has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Concerning the Day of Judgement, it is well known what it is. In reference to An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah, Qurrah bin Khalid reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he said about this Ayah, ""Verily, by Allah, we think that every believer blames himself. He says (questioning himself), `What did I intend by my statement What did I intend by my eating What did I intend in what I said to myself' However, the sinner proceeds ahead and he does not blame himself."" Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ </div><p>(And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah) ""He criticizes himself in good and bad."" Similar has been reported from `Ikrimah. Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid: ""He is sorry for what he missed (of good deeds) and he blames himself for it."" Allah said;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ </div><p>(Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) meaning, `on the Day of Judgement does he think that We are not able to return his bones and gather them from their various places'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ </div><p>(Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) meaning, `does man think that We will not gather his bones Surely, We will gather them and We are quite able to put together his fingertips. This means Our power is suitable to gather (and recreate) them, and if We wished We could surely resurrect him with more than what he originally had. We could make his Banan, which are the tips of his fingers, all equal (in length).' Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ </div><p>(Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) Sa`id reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""This means to proceed forward."" Mujahid said about,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ</div><p>(to break out ahead of himself.) ""This means that he wants to proceed ahead following his own whims."" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""This refers to the disbeliever who denies the Day of Reckoning."" Ibn Zayd said the same thing. Thus, Allah says after this,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ </div><p>(He asks: ""When will be this Day of Resurrection"") meaning, he says when will the Day of Judgement be His question is only a question of denying its occurrence, and rejecting its existence. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَـَخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: ""When is this promise if you are truthful"" Say: ""The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward."") (34:29-30) Here Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ </div><p>(So, when Bariqa the sight.) Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala' recited this Ayah as Bariqa with a Kasrah under the letter Ra, which means to be diminished. That which he (Abu `Amr) has said resembles the statement of Allah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ</div><p>(Their gaze returning not towards them.) (14:43) meaning, they will be looking this way and that way in horror. Their gaze will not be able to rest upon anything due to the severity of the terror on that Day. Others recited it as Baraqa with a Fathah over the letter Ra, and its meaning is close to the first recitation (Bariqa). The intent here is that the eyes will be dazzled, humbled, diminished, and humiliated on the Day of Judgement due to the severity of the horrors and the greatness of the matters that they will witness on that Day. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ </div><p>(And the moon will be eclipsed.) meaning, its light will go away.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ </div><p>(And the sun and moon will be joined together.) Mujahid said, ""They will be rolled up."" In explaining this Ayah, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ - وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ </div><p>(When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown, and when the stars fall.) (81:1,2) It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited the Ayah as, (وَجُمِعَ بَيْنَ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ) (and the sun and the moon will be joined between each other.) Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ </div><p>(On that Day man will say:""Where (is the refuge) to flee"") meaning, the human will see these horrors on the Day of Judgement and he will want to flee. He will say, ""Where (is the place) to flee to"" This means, where is the escape or refuge Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ </div><p>(No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others of the Salaf said, ""There will be no salvation."" This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ</div><p>(You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) (42:47) meaning, `there will be no place for you to hide.' This is like what Allah says here,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ وَزَرَ</div><p>(There is no refuge.) meaning, `there will be no place for you to seek shelter.' Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ </div><p>(Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) meaning, the place of return and the final destination. The Deeds of Man will be placed before Him on the Day of Judgement Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ </div><p>(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) meaning, he will be informed of all of his deeds, the old of them and the recent of them, the first of them and the last of them, the small of them and the large of them. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا</div><p>(And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Likewise, Allah says here,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ - وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ </div><p>(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) meaning, he will be a witness against himself, knowing full well what he did, even though he will try to make excuses and deny it. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">اقْرَأْ كَتَـبَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا </div><p>((It will be said to him): ""Read your book. You are sufficient as a reckoner against yourself this Day."") `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ </div><p>(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself.) ""His hearing, his sight, his two hands, his two legs and his limbs."" Qatadah said, ""This means he is a witness against himself."" In another narration from Qatadah he said, ""By Allah! If you wish to see him, you would see him as someone who sees the shortcomings of the people and their sins, yet he is heedless of his own sins."" It used to be said, ""Verily, it is written in the Injil: `O Son of Adam, do you see the small splinters in the eye of your brother and disregard the tree stump that is in your eye, so you do not see it""' Mujahid said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ </div><p>(Though he may put forth his excuses.) ""This means, even though he argues in defense of it, he is a witness against it."" Qatadah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ </div><p>(Though he may put forth his excuses.) ""Even though he will try to make false excuses on that Day, they will not be accepted from him."" As-Suddi said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ </div><p>(Though he may put forth his excuses.) ""This means his argument."" This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(There will then be no Fitnah for them but to say: ""By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah."") (6:23) Allah also says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ </div><p>(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something. Verily, they are liars!) (58:18) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ </div><p>(Though he may put forth his excuses.) ""This is apologizing. Haven't you heard that Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ</div><p>(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers.) (40:52) and He says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَى اللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ السَّلَمَ</div><p>(And they will offer submision to Allah on that Day.) (16:87) and He says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَأَلْقَوُاْ السَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوءٍ</div><p>(Then they will (falsely) submit: ""We used not to do any evil."") (16:28) and their statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</div><p>(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.)

5592,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Recitation of Surat As-Sajdah and Al-Insan in the Morning Prayer on Friday</h2><p>It has been mentioned previously that it is recorded in Sahih Muslim from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite in the Morning prayer on Friday:</p><p>الم تَنزِيلَ</p><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation...)(32) and;</p><p>هَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ</p><p>(Has there not been over man...) (76)</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Allah created Man after He did not exist</h2><p>Allah informs that He brought man into existence after he was not even a thing worth mentioning, due to his lowliness and weakness. Allah says,</p><p>هَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئاً مَّذْكُوراً</p><p>(Has there not been over man a period of time, when he was not a thing worth mentioning) Then Allah explains this by saying,</p><p>إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ</p><p>(Verily, We have created man from Nutfah Amshaj,) meaning, mixed. The words Mashaj and Mashij mean something that is mixed together. Ibn `Abbas said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ</p><p>(from Nutfah Amshaj,) ""This means the fluid of the man and the fluid of the woman when they meet and mix."" Then man changes after this from stage to stage, condition to condition and color to color. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas all made statements similar to this. They said, ""Amshaj is the mixing of the man's fluid with the woman's fluid."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>نَّبْتَلِيهِ</p><p>(in order to try him,) means, `We test him.' It is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً</p><p>(That He may test you which of you is best in deed.) (67:2) Then Allah says,</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً</p><p>(so, We made him hearer and seer.) meaning, `We gave him the faculties of hearing and sight so that he would be able to use them for obedience and disobedience.'</p><h2>Allah guided Him to the Path, so Man is either Grateful or Ungrateful</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّا هَدَيْنَـهُ السَّبِيلَ</p><p>(Verily, We guided to him the way,) meaning, `We explained it to him, made it clear to him and showed it to him.' This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</p><p>(And as for Thamud, We guided them but they preferred blindness to guidance.) (41:17) Allah also said,</p><p>وَهَدَيْنَـهُ النَّجْدَينِ</p><p>(And We guided him to the two ways.) (90:10) meaning, `We explained to him the path of good and the path of evil.' This is the statement of `Ikrimah, `Atiyah, Ibn Zayd and Mujahid from what is well-known from him and the majority. Allah then says,</p><p>إِمَّا شَاكِراً وَإِمَّا كَفُوراً</p><p>(Whether he be grateful or ungrateful.) This is his decree. Thus, with this he is either wretched or happy. This is like what has been recorded by Muslim in a Hadith from Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari. He said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ النَّاسِ يَغْدُو فَبَائِعٌ نَفْسَهُ، فَمُوبِقُهَا أَوْ مُعْتِقُهَا»</p><p>(All of mankind wakes up in the morning the merchant of his own soul. So he either imprisons it or sets it free. )</p>"

5595,"<h2>The Recompense of the Disbelievers and the Righteous</h2><p>Allah informs of what he has waiting for those who disbelieve in Him from His creatures of chains, iron collars and Sa`ir. Sa`ir is the flame and fire of the Hell. This is as Allah says,</p><p>إِذِ الاٌّغْلَـلُ فِى أَعْنَـقِهِمْ والسَّلَـسِلُ يُسْحَبُونَ - فِى الْحَمِيمِ ثُمَّ فِى النَّارِ يُسْجَرُونَ</p><p>(When iron collars will be rounded over their necks, and the chains, they shall be dragged along, in the boiling water, then they will be burned in the Fire.) (40:71,72) After mentioning the blazing Fire He has prepared for these wretched people, Allah goes on to say,</p><p>إِنَّ الاٌّبْرَارَ يَشْرَبُونَ مِن كَأْسٍ كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا كَـفُوراً</p><p>(Verily, the Abrar (righteous believers) shall drink of a cup mixed with Kafur.) The properties of the Kafur (camphor) are well known; cooling, having a nice fragrance and in addition to this its taste will be delicious in Paradise. Al-Hasan said, ""The coolness of the camphor will be in the pleasantness of ginger."" Thus Allah said,</p><p>عَيْناً يَشْرَبُ بِهَا عِبَادُ اللَّهِ يُفَجِّرُونَهَا تَفْجِيراً</p><p>(A spring wherefrom the servants of Allah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly.) meaning, this (drink) that will be mixed for these righteous people will be taken from Kafur, which is a spring that Allah's close servants will drink directly from, without it being mixed with anything, and they will drink to their fill from it. The word Yashrabu (to drink) includes the meaning of Yarwa (to quench one's thirst). Allah then says,</p><p>يُفَجِّرُونَهَا تَفْجِيراً</p><p>(causing it to gush forth abundantly (Tafjir).) meaning, they will have control of it however and wherever they wish. They will have access to it from their castles, their homes, their sitting rooms and their residences. At-Tafjir means to cause to gush forth or flow out. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا</p><p>(And they say: ""We shall not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us.) (17:90) And Allah says,</p><p>وَفَجَّرْنَا خِلَـلَهُمَا نَهَراً</p><p>(We caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them.) (18:33) Mujahid said,</p><p>يُفَجِّرُونَهَا تَفْجِيراً</p><p>(causing it to gush forth abundantly.) ""This means that they will divert it to wherever they wish."" `Ikrimah and Qatadah both made similar statements. Ath-Thawri said, ""They will cause it to flow wherever they wish.""</p><h2>The Deeds of these Righteous People</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>يُوفُونَ بِالنَّذْرِ وَيَخَـفُونَ يَوْماً كَانَ شَرُّهُ مُسْتَطِيراً</p><p>(They fulfill vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be wide-spreading.) meaning, they devote to worship Allah using that which He made obligatory upon them from actions of obligatory obedience that is based on Islamic legislation. They also worship Him by fulfilling their vows. Imam Malik reported from Talhah bin `Abdul-Malik Al-Ayli, who reported from Al-Qasim bin Malik, from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ نَذَرَ أَنْ يُطِيعَ اللهَ فَلْيُطِعْهُ، وَمَنْ نَذَرَ أَنْ يَعْصِيَ اللهَ فَلَا يَعْصِه»</p><p>(Whoever makes a vow to obey Allah, then he should obey Him. And whoever makes a vow to disobey Allah, then he should not disobey Him.) Al-Bukhari also recorded this Hadith from Malik. These people also abandon those forbidden things which He (Allah) has prohibited for them, due to their fear of having an evil reckoning on the Day of Return. This is the Day when the evil will spread out among all people except for those upon whom Allah has had mercy. Ibn `Abbas said, ""Spreading."" Qatadah said, ""By Allah! The evil of that Day will spread until it fills the heavens and the earth."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</p><p>(And they give food, inspite of their love for it,) It has been said that this means the love of Allah, the Most High. In their view the pronoun refers to Allah. However, the most apparent meaning is that the pronoun refers to the food. This would mean, they give food while they themselves love it and desire it. This was stated by Mujahid and Muqatil, and it was the preferred opinion of Ibn Jarir. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَءَاتَى الْمَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</p><p>(And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it.) (2:177) Allah also says,</p><p>لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ</p><p>(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr unless you spend of that which you love.) (3:92) In the Sahih, there is a Hadith which states,</p><p>«أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقَةِ أَنْ تَصَدَّقَ وَأَنْتَ صَحِيحٌ شَحِيحٌ، تَأْمُلُ الْغِنَى وَتَخْشَى الْفَقْر»</p><p>(The best charity is that which you give while you are healthy, covetous, hoping for wealth and fearing poverty.) This means in the condition of your love for wealth, your eagerness for it and your need for it. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ مِسْكِيناً وَيَتِيماً وَأَسِيراً</p><p>(And they give food, inspite of their love for it, to the poor, the orphan and the captive,) Concerning the poor person and the orphan, an explanation of them and their characteristics has already preceded. In reference to the captive, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and Ad-Dahhak all said, ""He is the captive among the people of the Qiblah (i.e., the Muslims)."" Ibn `Abbas said, ""At that time (when this Ayah was revealed) their (the Muslims') captives were idolators."" Proof for this is that on the day of Badr the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded his Companions to treat the captives respectfully. They (the Companions) would give them preference over themselves when eating their meals. `Ikrimah said, ""They (captives) are the slaves."" Ibn Jarir preferred this opinion since the Ayah generally refers to both the Muslim and the idolators. Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata', Al-Hasan and Qatadah all made similar statements. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ advised treating servants well in more than one Hadith. This held such importance with him that the last statement of advice that he gave (before dying) was his saying,</p><p>«الصَّلَاةَ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُم»</p><p>(The prayer (As-Salah) and what your right hand possesses (slaves).) Mujahid said, ""He (the captive) is the prisoner."" This means that these (righteous) people give food to others even though they themselves desire it and love it, saying at the same time,</p><p>إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(We feed you seeking Allah's Face only.) meaning, hoping for the reward of Allah and His pleasure.</p><p>لاَ نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَآءً وَلاَ شُكُوراً</p><p>(We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you.) meaning, `we do not seek any reward from you in return for it. We also are not seeking for you to thank us in front of the people.' Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr both said, ""By Allah! They do not say this with their tongues, but rather, Allah knows it in their hearts and He commends them for it. Every seeker should seek after this.""</p><p>إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْماً عَبُوساً قَمْطَرِيراً</p><p>(Verily, We fear from our Lord a Day that is `Abus and Qamtarir.) meaning, `we only do this so that perhaps Allah may have mercy on us and treat us with gentleness on the Day that is `Abus and Qamtarir.' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""`Abus means difficult and Qamtarir means long."" `Ikrimah and others said from Ibn Abbas,</p><p>يَوْماً عَبُوساً قَمْطَرِيراً</p><p>(a Day that is `Abus and Qamtarir (hard and distressful, that will make the faces look horrible from extreme dislike to it.)) ""The disbeliever will frown on that day until sweat will flow between his eyes like tar."" Mujahid said, ""Abus `Abis means (frowning with) the two lips and Qamtarir means drawing up the face in a scowl."" Sa`id bin Jubayr and Qatadah said, ""Faces will be made to frown due to dismay. Qamtarir is the contraction of the forehead and what is between the two eyes due to dismay."" Ibn Zayd said, "" `Abus is the evil and Qamtarir is the severity.""</p><h2>Some Details concerning the Reward of the Righteous in Paradise and what it contains of Delights</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>فَوَقَـهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَومِ وَلَقَّـهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُوراً</p><p>(So, Allah saved them from the evil of that Day, and gave them Nadrah (a light of beauty) and joy.) This is used as a way of eloquence in stating similarity (i.e., two similar things).</p><p>فَوَقَـهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَومِ</p><p>(So, Allah saved them from the evil of that Day,) meaning, He protects them from that which they fear of it.</p><p>وَلَقَّـهُمْ نَضْرَةً</p><p>(and gave them Nadrah (a light of beauty)) meaning, in their faces.</p><p>وَسُرُوراً</p><p>(And joy) in their hearts. Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Abu `Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas all stated this. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ - ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ</p><p>(Some faces that Day will be bright, laughing, rejoicing at good news.) This is because if the heart is happy, then the face will be enlightened. As Ka`b bin Malik said in his lengthy Hadith about Allah's Messenger ﷺ, whenever he was happy, then his face will be radiant until it will be as if it is a piece of the moon. `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered into my home happy and his facial expression was glowing."" And the Hadith continues. dAllah then says,</p><p>وَجَزَاهُمْ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ</p><p>(And their recompense because they were patient) meaning, due to their patience He will give them, bestow upon them and accommodate them with Paradise and silken garments. This means a home that is spacious, a delightful life and fine clothing. Al-Hafiz Ibn `Asakir said in his biography of Hisham bin Sulayman Ad-Darani, ""Surat Al-Insan was recited to Abu Sulayman Ad-Darani, and when the reciter reached the Ayah where Allah says,</p><p>وَجَزَاهُمْ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ جَنَّةً وَحَرِيراً</p><p>(And their recompense shall be Paradise, and silken garments, because they were patient.) he (Abu Sulayman) said, `Because they were patient in leaving off their desires in the world.""'</p>"

5623,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, ""While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,</p><p>وَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ</p><p>(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اقْتُلُوهَا»</p><p>(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,</p><p>«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»</p><p>(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)"" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting</p><p>وَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً</p><p>(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting</p><p>وَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً</p><p>(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, ""O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died)."" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Allah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p><p>وَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً</p><p>(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) ""The angels."" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, ""These are the Messenger ﷺ."" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, ""The wind."" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</p><p>(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ</p><p>(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,</p><p>فَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً</p><p>(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ</p><p>(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.</p><h2>A Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><p>فَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ</p><p>(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ</p><p>(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ</p><p>(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ</p><p>(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.</p><p>وَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ</p><p>(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً</p><p>(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, ""My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust."") (20:105) Allah also says,</p><p>"" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً</p><p>(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ</p><p>(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means ""Gathered."" Ibn Zayd said, ""This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ</p><p>(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,</p><p>أُقِّتَتْ</p><p>(Uqqitat.) ""This means postponed."" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,</p><p>أُقِّتَتْ</p><p>(Uqqitat.) ""This means promised."" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,</p><p>لأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,</p><p>فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</p><p>(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,</p><p>لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ</p><p>(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future.</p>"

Meaning the dreadful, horrifying, overwhelming information.</p><p>الَّذِى هُمْ فِيهِ مُخْتَلِفُونَ</p><p>(About which they are in disagreement.) meaning, the people are divided into two ideas about it. There are those who believe in it and those who disbelieve in it. Then Allah threatens those who deny the Day of Judgement by saying,</p><p>كَلاَّ سَيَعْلَمُونَ - ثُمَّ كَلاَّ سَيَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(Nay, they will come to know! Nay, again, they will come to know!) This is a severe threat and a direct warning.</p><h2>Mentioning Allah's Power, and the Proof of His Ability to resurrect the Dead</h2><p>Then, Allah begins to explain His great ability to create strange things and amazing matters. He brings this as a proof of His ability to do whatever He wishes concerning the matter of the Hereafter and other matters as well. He says,</p><p>أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ الاٌّرْضَ مِهَـداً</p><p>(Have We not made the earth as a bed,) meaning, an established, firm and peaceful resting place that is subservient to them.</p><p>وَالْجِبَالَ أَوْتَاداً</p><p>(And the mountains as pegs) meaning, He made them as pegs for the earth to hold it in place, make it stable and firm. This is so that it may be suitable for dwelling and not quake with those who are in it. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَخَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَزْوَجاً</p><p>(And We have created you in pairs.) meaning, male and female, both of them enjoying each other, and by this means procreation is achieved. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمِنْ ءايَـتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَجاً لِّتَسْكُنُواْ إِلَيْهَا وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً</p><p>(And among His signs is this that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy.) (30:21)</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتاً</p><p>(And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest.) meaning, a cessation of movement in order to attain rest from the frequent repetition and going about in search of livelihood during the day. A similar Ayah has been mentioned previously in Surat Al-Furqan.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا الَّيْلَ لِبَاساً</p><p>(And We have made the night as a covering,) meaning, its shade and darkness covers the people. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَـهَا</p><p>(By the night as it conceals it.) (91:4) Qatadah commented;</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا الَّيْلَ لِبَاساً</p><p>(And We have made the night as a covering,) meaning, a tranquil residence. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا النَّهَارَ مَعَاشاً</p><p>(And We have made the day for livelihood.) meaning, `We made it radiant, luminous, and shining so that the people would be able to move about in it.' By it they are able to come and go for their livelihood, earning, business dealings and other than that as well. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَبَنَيْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعاً شِدَاداً</p><p>(And We have built above you seven strong,) meaning, the seven heavens in their vastness, loftiness, perfection, precision, and adornment with both stable and moving stars. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجاً وَهَّاجاً</p><p>(And We have made (therein) a shining lamp.) meaning, the radiant sun that gives light to all of the world. Its light glows for all of the people of the earth. Allah then says,</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ الْمُعْصِرَاتِ مَآءً ثَجَّاجاً</p><p>(And We have sent down from the Mu`sirat water Thajjaj.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""From the Mu`sirat means from the clouds."" This was also stated by `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ath-Thawri, and it is preferred by Ibn Jarir. Al-Farra' said, ""They are the clouds that are filled with rain, but they do not bring rain. This is like the woman being called Mu`sir when (the time of) her menstrual cycle approaches, yet she does not menstruate."" This is as Allah says,</p><p>اللَّهُ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَـحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَاباً فَيَبْسُطُهُ فِى السَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُ كِسَفاً فَتَرَى الْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلاَلِهِ</p><p>(Allah is He Who sends the winds, so that they raise clouds, and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then break them into fragments, until you see rain drops come forth from their midst!) (30:48) meaning, from its midst. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مَآءً ثَجَّاجاً</p><p>(water Thajjaj) Mujahid, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas all said, ""Thajjaj means poured out."" At-Thawri said, ""Continuous."" Ibn Zayd said, ""Abundant."" In the Hadith of the woman with prolonged menstrual bleeding, when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to her,</p><p>«أَنْعَتُ لَكِ الْكُرْسُف»</p><p>(I suggest you to make an absorbent cloth for yourself.)"" Meaning, `dress the area with cotton.' The woman replied, ""O Messenger of Allah! It (the bleeding) is too much for that. Verily, it flows in profusely (Thajja)."" This contains an evidence for using the word Thajj to mean abundant, continuous and flowing. And Allah knows best.

This is why Allah says</p><p>وَجَنَّـتٍ أَلْفَافاً</p><p>(And gardens that are Alfaf.) Ibn `Abbas and other said, ""Alfaf means gathered."" This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَـوِرَتٌ وَجَنَّـتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَـبٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ صِنْوَنٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَنٍ يُسْقَى بِمَآءٍ وَحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(And in the earth are neighboring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops, and date palms, growing into two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise, watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.

5713,"<h2>The Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at (Chapter - 79) Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div>
<p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<h2>Swearing by Five Characteristics that the Day of Judgement will occur</h2>
<p>Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, Abu Ad-Duha and As-Suddi all said,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالنَّـزِعَـتِ غَرْقاً</div>
<p>(By those who pull out, drowning.) ""These are the angels who remove the souls from the Children of Adam."" Among them are those whose souls are removed by the angels with difficulty, as if he is being drowned during its removal. There are those people whose souls the angels remove with ease, as if they were unraveling him (i.e., his soul from him) due to their briskness. This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالنَّـشِطَـتِ نَشْطاً</div>
<p>(By those who free briskly.) This has been mentioned by Ibn `Abbas. In reference to Allah's statement,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالسَّـبِحَـتِ سَبْحاً</div>
<p>(And by the swimmers, swimming.) Ibn Mas`ud said, ""They are the angels."" Similar statements have been reported from `Ali, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, and Abu Salih. Concerning Allah's statement,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَالسَّـبِقَـتِ سَبْقاً</div>
<p>(And by the racers, racing.) It has been narrated from `Ali, Masruq, Mujahid, Abu Salih, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri that this means the angels. Then Allah says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَالْمُدَبِّرَتِ أَمْراً</div>
<p>(And by those who arrange affairs.) `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Salih, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, and As-Suddi all said, ""They are the angels."" Al-Hasan added, ""They control the affairs from the heaven to the earth, meaning by the command of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.""</p>
<h2>The Description of the Day of Judgement, the People, and what They will say</h2>
<p>Then Allah says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ - تَتْبَعُهَا الرَّادِفَةُ</div>
<p>(On the Day the Rajifah shakes, followed by the Radifah.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second."" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, ""In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ</div>
<p>(On the Day the Rajifah shakes,) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ</div>
<p>(On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.) (73:14) The second is Ar-Radifah, and it is like the Allah's statement,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَحُمِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَحِدَةً</div>
<p>(And the earth and mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.) (69:14)"" Concerning Allah's statement,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">قُلُوبٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاجِفَةٌ</div>
<p>(Hearts that Day will tremble.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""This means afraid."" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَبْصَـرُهَا خَـشِعَةٌ</div>
<p>(Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الْحَـفِرَةِ</div>
<p>(They say: ""Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah"") meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـٰمًا نَّخِرَةً</div>
<p>(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, ""This means decayed."" Ibn `Abbas said, ""It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it."" Concerning their saying,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">تِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ</div>
<p>(It would in that case be a return with loss.) (79:12) Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Quraysh said, ""If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers."" Allah then says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ</div>
<p>(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً</div>
<p>(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ</div>
<p>(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) Allah also says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ</div>
<p>(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ</div>
<p>(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""As-Sahirah means the entire earth."" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, ""As-Sahirah means the face of the earth."" Mujahid said, ""They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part."" Then he said, ""As-Sahirah is a level place."" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ</div>
<p>(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) ""Allah says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</div>
<p>(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:48) and He says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً - فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً - لاَّ تَرَى فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلا أَمْتاً</div>
<p>(And they ask you concerning the mountains: say, ""My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust. Then He shall leave them as a level smooth plain.You will see therein nothing crooked or curved.) (20:105-107) and Allah says,</p>
<div class=""arabic uthmani"">"" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً</div>
<p>(And the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away, and you will see the earth as a leveled plain.) (18:47) and the earth will be brought forth which will have mountains upon it, and it will not be considered from this earth (of this life). It will be an earth that no sin will be performed on it, nor will any blood be shed upon it.""</p>"

While he was speaking in direct conversation with him, Ibn Umm Maktum came to him, and he was of those who had accepted Islam in its earliest days. He (Ibn Umm Maktum) then began asking the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about something, urgently beseeching him. The Prophet hoped that the man would be guided, so he asked Ibn Umm Maktum to wait for a moment so he could complete his conversation. He frowned in the face of Ibn Umm Maktum and turned away from him in order to face the other man. Thus, Allah revealed,</p><p>عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى - أَن جَآءَهُ الاٌّعْمَى - وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُ يَزَّكَّى</p><p>(He frowned and turned away. Because there came to him the blind man. And how can you know that he might become pure) meaning, he may attain purification and cleanliness in his soul.</p><p>أَوْ يَذَّكَّرُ فَتَنفَعَهُ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(Or he might receive admonition, and the admonition might profit him) meaning, he may receive admonition and abstain from the forbidden.</p><p>أَمَّا مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى - فَأَنتَ لَهُ تَصَدَّى</p><p>(As for him who thinks himself self-sufficient. To him you attend;) meaning, `you face the rich person so that perhaps he may be guided.'</p><p>وَمَا عَلَيْكَ أَلاَّ يَزَّكَّى</p><p>(What does it matter to you if he will not become pure) meaning, `you are not responsible for him if he does not attain purification.'</p><p>وَأَمَّا مَن جَآءَكَ يَسْعَى - وَهُوَ يَخْشَى</p><p>(But as for him who came to you running. And is afraid.) meaning, `he is seeking you and he comes to you so that he may be guided by what you say to him.'</p><p>فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّى</p><p>(Of him you are neglectful and divert your attention to another.) meaning, `you are too busy.' Here Allah commands His Messenger to not single anyone out with the warning. Rather, he should equal warn the noble and the weak, the poor and the rich, the master and the slave, the men and the women, the young and the old. Then Allah will guide whomever He chooses to a path that is straight. He has the profound wisdom and the decisive proof. Abu Ya`la and Ibn Jarir both recorded from `A'ishah that she said about,</p><p>عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(He frowned and turned away.) was revealed."" At-Tirmirdhi recorded this Hadith but he did not mention that it was narrated by `A'ishah. I say it is reported like this in Al-Muwatta' as well.</p><h2>The Characteristics of the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ</p><p>(Nay; indeed it is an admonition.) meaning, this Surah, or this advice in conveying knowledge equally among people, whether they are of noble or low class. Qatadah and As-Suddi both said,</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ</p><p>(Nay; indeed it is an admonition.) ""This means the Qur'an.""</p><p>فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ</p><p>(So, whoever wills, let him pay attention to Him (it).) meaning, so whoever wills, he remembers Allah in all of his affairs. The pronoun could also be understood to be referring to the revelation since the conversation is alluding to it. Allah said:</p><p>فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ - مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ</p><p>(In Records held in honor, exalted, purified.) meaning, this Surah or this admonition. Both meanings are connected to each other. Actually, all of the Qur'an is in honored pages, meaning respected and revered.</p><p>مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(exalted) meaning, elevated in status.</p><p>مُّطَهَّرَةٍ</p><p>(purified) meaning, from impurity, additions and deficiency. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ</p><p>(In the hands of ambassadors (Safarah),) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd, all said, ""These are the angels."" Al-Bukhari said, ""Safarah (ambassadors) refers to the angels. They travel around rectifying matters between themselves. The angels when they descend with the revelation of Allah, bringing it like the ambassador who rectifies matters between people."" Allah said,</p><p>كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Honorable and obedient.) meaning, they are noble, handsome, and honorable in their creation. Their character and their deeds are righteous, pure and perfect. Here it should be noted that it is necessary for one who carries the Qur'an (i.e., the angel) to be following righteousness and guidance. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الَّذِي يَقْرَأُ الْقُرْآنَ وَهُوَ مَاهِرٌ بِهِ، مَعَ السَّفَرَةِ الْكِرَامِ الْبَرَرَةِ، وَالَّذِي يَقْرَؤُهُ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِ شَاقٌّ، لَهُ أَجْرَان»</p><p>(He who recites the Qur'an proficiently, will be with the noble, righteous, ambassador angels, and the one who recites it with difficulty will receive two rewards.) This Hadith was reported by the group.</p>"

(81:1) (and; (When the heaven is cleft asunder.) (82:1) (and; (When the heaven is split asunder.) (84:1)) Likewise, At-Tirmidhi has also recorded this Hadith.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>What will happen on the Day of Judgement, and that is the rolling up of the Sun</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ</p><p>(When the sun is Kuwwirat.) ""This means it will be darkened."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas; ""It will go away."" Qatadah said, ""Its light will go away."" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, ""Kuwwirat means it will sink in."" Abu Salih said, ""Kuwwirat means it will be thrown down."" At-Takwir means to gather one part of something with another part of it (i.e., folding). From it comes the folding of the turban (`Imamah) and the folding of clothes together. Thus, the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>كُوِّرَتْ</p><p>(Kuwwirat) is that part of it will be folded up into another part of it. Then it will be rolled up and thrown away. When this is done to it, its light will go away. Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ يُكَوَّرَانِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(The sun and the moon will be rolled up on the Day of Judgement.) Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith and this is his wording of it.</p><h2>Dispersing the Stars</h2><p>وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ</p><p>(And when the stars Inkadarat.) meaning, when they are scattered. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ</p><p>(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) The basis of the word Inkidar is Insibab, which means to be poured out. Ar-Rabi` bin Anas reported from Abu Al-`Aliyah, who reported from Ubayy bin Ka`b that he said, ""Six signs will take place before the Day of Judgement. The people will be in their marketplaces when the sun's light will go away. When they are in that situation, the stars will be scattered. When they are in that situation, the mountains will fall down upon the face of the earth, and the earth will move, quake and be in a state of mixed up confusion. So the Jinns will then flee in fright to the humans and the humans will flee to the Jinns. The domestic beasts, birds and wild animals will mix together, and they will surge together in a wave (of chaos).</p><p>وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ</p><p>(And when the wild beasts are gathered together.) This means they will be mixed.</p><p>وَإِذَا الْعِشَارُ عُطِّلَتْ</p><p>(And when the pregnant she camels are neglected;) This means their owners will neglect them.</p><p>وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the seas become as blazing fire)"" Then he (Ubayy) went on to say, ""The Jinns will say, `We come to you with news.' So they will all go to the sea, and it will be a blazing fire. While they are in that state, the earth will be split with one huge crack that will extend from the lowest, seventh earth to the highest, seventh heaven. So while they are in that state, a wind will come that will kill all of them."" Ibn Jarir recorded this narration with this wording.</p><h2>Moving of the Mountains, abandoning of the Pregnant She-Camels, and the gathering of the Wild Beasts</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ سُيِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the mountains are made to pass away;) meaning, they will not remain in their places and they will be destroyed. Then the earth will be left as a flat, level plain. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْعِشَارُ عُطِّلَتْ</p><p>(And when the pregnant she-camels (`Ishar) are neglected (`Uttilat);) `Ikrimah and Mujahid said, ""`Ishar are (pregnant she-) camels."" Mujahid said, ""`Uttilat means abandoned and left."" Ubayy bin Ka`b and Ad-Dahhak both said, ""Their owners will neglect them."" Ar-Rabi` bin Khuthaym said, ""They will not be milked or tied up. Their masters will leave them abandoned."" Ad-Dahhak said, ""They will be left with no one to tend to them."" And the meaning of all of these statements is similar. What is intended is that the `Ishar is a type of camel. It is actually the best type of camel, and particularly the pregnant females of them when they have reached the tenth month of their pregnancies. One of them is singularly referred to as `Ushara', and she keeps that name until she gives birth. So the people will be too busy to tend to her, take care of her or benefit from her, after she used to be the most important thing to them. This will be due to what will suddenly overtake them of the great, terrifying and horrible situation. This is the matter of the Day of Judgement, the coming together of its causes, and the occurrence of those things that will happen before it.</p><p>وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ</p><p>(And when the wild beasts are gathered together.) meaning, gathered. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَـلُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِى الكِتَـبِ مِن شَىْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ</p><p>(There is not a moving creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they shall be gathered.) (6:38) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Everything will be gathered, even the flies."" This statement was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Allah also says,</p><p>وَالطَّيْرَ مَحْشُورَةً</p><p>(And (so did) the birds assembled.) 38:19 meaning, gathered.</p><h2>The Blazing of the Seas</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the seas become as blazing fire.) Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib that `Ali said to a Jewish man, ""Where is the Hell"" The man said, ""The sea."" `Ali then said, ""I think he is truthful, as Allah says</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the seas kindled (Masjur).) (52:6) and;</p><p>وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)"" This has already been discussed previously with the explanation of Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the seas kindled (Masjur).) (52:6)</p><h2>Joining the Souls</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ</p><p>(And when the souls are joined with their mates.) meaning, every type (of soul) will be gathered with its peer (or mate). This is as Allah says,</p><p>احْشُرُواْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَأَزْوَجَهُمْ</p><p>(It will be said to the angels): ""Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils).) (37:22) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from An-Nu`man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ</p><p>الضُّرَبَاءُ: كُلُّ رَجُلٍ مَعَ كُلِّ قَوْمٍ كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلَهُ وَذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَقُولُ:</p><p>وَكُنتُمْ أَزْوَاجاً ثَلَـثَةً - فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>هُمُ الضُّرَبَاء»</p><p>((And When the souls are joined with their mates.)( Those who are alike. Every man will be with every group of people who performed the same deeds that he did. (This is because Allah says, (And you (all) will be in three groups. So those on the Right Hand - how (fortunate) will be those on Right Hand! And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand!) (56: 7-10) (They are those who are alike.)</p><h2>Questioning the Female Infant Who was buried Alive</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَتْ - بِأَىِّ ذَنبٍ قُتِلَتْ</p><p>(And when the female infant (Al-Maw'udah) buried alive is questioned: For what sin was she killed) The majority have recited it as Su'ilat (she is questioned), as it is here. Al-Maw'udah is the female infant that the people of the pre-Islamic time of ignorance would bury in the dirt due to their hatred of girls. Therefore, on the Day of Judgement, the female infant will be asked what sin she committed that caused here to be murdered. This will be a means of frightening her murderer. For verily, if the one who was wronged is questioned, what does the wrongdoer (the one who is guilty of the oppression) think then `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَتْ</p><p>(And when the female infant (Al-Maw'udah) buried alive Su'ilat:) ""This means that she will ask."" Abu Ad-Duha made a similar statement when he said, ""She will ask, meaning she will demand restitution for her blood."" The same has been reported from As-Suddi and Qatadah. Hadiths have been reported concerning the Maw'udah. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah, who reported from Judamah bint Wahb, the sister of `Ukkashah, that she said, ""I was in the presence of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he was with some people, and he said,</p><p>«لَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ أَنْ أَنْهَى عَنِ الْغِيلَةِ فَنَظَرْتُ فِي الرُّومِ وَفَارِسَ، فَإِذَا هُمْ يُغِيلُونَ أَوْلَادَهُمْ، وَلَا يَضُرُّ أَوْلَادَهُمْ ذلِكَ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(I was about to prohibit sexual relations with breast feeding women, but then I saw that the Romans and the Persians have sexual relations with their women who breast feed their children and it does not harm the children at all.) Then they asked him about interruption of sexual intercourse to prevent the male discharge from entering the womb of the woman, and he said,</p><p>«ذلِكَ الْوَأْدُ الْخَفِيُّ، وَهُوَ الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَت»</p><p>(That is the minor infanticide and it is the female infant buried alive (Maw'udah) that will be questioned.)"" Muslim, Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i, all recorded this Hadith as well.</p><h2>The Atonement for burying Infant Girls Alive</h2><p>`Abdur-Razzaq said that Isra'il informed them from Simak bin Harb, from An-Nu`man bin Bashir, who reported from `Umar bin Al-Khattab that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَتْ</p><p>(And when the female infant buried alive is questioned.) ""Qays bin `Asim came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Verily, I buried some daughters of mine alive in the period of pre-Islamic ignorance.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَعْتِقْ عَنْ كُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْهُنَّ رَقَبَة»</p><p>(Free a slave for each one of them.) Then Qays said, `O Messenger of Allah! Verily, I am an owner of camels.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«فَانْحَرْ عَنْ كُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْهُنَّ بَدَنَة»</p><p>(Then sacrifice a camel for each one of them.)""</p><h2>The Distribution of the Pages</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الصُّحُفُ نُشِرَتْ</p><p>(And when the pages are laid open.) Ad-Dahhak said, ""Every person will be given his paper in his right hand or in his left hand."" Qatadah said, ""O Son of Adam ! It (your paper) is written in, then it is rolled up, then it will be distributed to you on the Day of Judgement. So let each man look at what he himself dictated to be written in his paper.""</p><h2>Removing the Heavens, kindling Hellfire, and Paradise being brought near</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ كُشِطَتْ</p><p>(And when the heaven is Kushitat;) Mujahid said, ""It drawns away."" As-Suddi said, ""Stripped off."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْجَحِيمُ سُعِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when Hell is Su`irat.) As-Suddi said, ""It is heated."" In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْجَنَّةُ أُزْلِفَتْ</p><p>(And when Paradise is brought near.) Ad-Dahhak, Abu Malik, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi` bin Khuthaym, all said, ""This means it will be brought near to its inhabitants.""</p><h2>Everyone will know what He has brought on the Day of Judgement Concerning</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلِمَتْ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أَحْضَرَتْ</p><p>(Every person will know what he has brought.) This is the conclusive response of the previous statements, meaning at the time these matters occur, every soul will know what it has done, and that will be brought forth for it, as Allah says,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَرًا وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِن سُوءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُ أَمَدَا بَعِيدًا</p><p>(On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil.) (3:30) Allah also says,</p><p>يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ</p><p>(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) (75:13)</p>"

It has been previously mentioned in a narration from `Abdullah bin `Umar that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ سَرَّهُ أَنْ يَنْظُرَ إِلَى الْقِيَامَةِ رَأْيَ عَيْنٍ فَلْيَقْرَأْ:</p><p>إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ</p><p>و</p><p>إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انفَطَرَتْ</p><p>و</p><p>إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ »</p><p>(Whoever would be pleased to look at the Day of Resurrection with his own eyes, then let him recite, (When the sun is Kuwwirat.)

What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous) This is a threat. It is not an attempt to get a reply as some people mistakenly think. They consider it as if the Most Generous is asking them so that they will say, ""His honor deceived him (or made him careless of his Lord)."" rather the meaning of this Ayah is, ""O Son of Adam! What has deceived you from your Lord, the Most Generous -- meaning the Most Great -- so that you went forth disobeying Him, and you met Him with that which was unbefitting."" This is similar to what has been reported in the Hadith,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ مَا غَرَّكَ بِي؟ يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ مَاذَا أَجَبْتَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ؟»</p><p>(Allah will say on the Day of Judgement: ""O Son of Adam!

So Allah revealed,</p><p>مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ الْكَرِيمِ</p><p>(What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous)"" Then Allah said,</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّاكَ فَعَدَلَكَ</p><p>(Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion.) meaning, `what has deceived you concerning the Most Generous Lord'</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّاكَ فَعَدَلَكَ</p><p>(Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion.) meaning, `He made you complete, straight, and perfectly balanced and proportioned in stature. He fashioned you in the best of forms and shapes.' Imam Ahmad recorded from Busr bin Jahhash Al-Qurashi that one day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spat in his palm and placed his finger on it. Then he said,</p><p>«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ أَنْى تُعْجِزُنِي وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِنْ مِثْلِ هذِهِ؟ حَتْى إِذَا سَوَّيْتُكَ وَعَدَلْتُكَ مَشَيْتَ بَيْنَ بُرْدَيْنِ، وَلِلْأَرْضِ مِنْكَ وَئِيدٌ، فَجَمَعْتَ وَمَنَعْتَ حَتْى إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِيَ قُلْتَ: أَتَصَدَّقُ وَأَنَّى أَوَانُ الصَّدَقَةِ؟»</p><p>(Allah the Mighty and Sublime says: ""O Son of Adam!

Mujahid said, ""In which resemblance: the father, the mother, the paternal uncle, or the maternal uncle."" In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Abu Hurayrah that a man said, ""O Messenger of Allah! Verily, my wife has given birth to a black boy."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ لَكَ مِنْ إِبِلٍ؟»</p><p>(Do you have any camels) The man said, ""Yes."" The Prophet then said,</p><p>«فَمَا أَلْوَانُهَا»</p><p>(What color are they) The man said, ""Red."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«فَهَلْ فِيهَا مِنْ أَوْرَق»</p><p>(Do any of them have patches of gray) The man said, ""Yes."" The Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَأَنْى أَتَاهَا ذلِك»</p><p>(How did this happen to them) The man replied, ""It is probably an inherited genetical strain.""

From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their two knees. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their groins. From among them there will be those who will be bridled in sweat (up to their necks).) This Hadith was recorded by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi. In Sunan Abu Dawud it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to seek refuge with Allah from the hardship of standing on the Day of Judgement. It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that they will be standing for forty years with their heads raised toward the sky. No one will speak to them, and the righteous and wicked among them will all be bridled in sweat. It has been reported from Ibn `Umar that they will be standing for one hundred years. Both of these statements have been recorded by Ibn Jarir. In the Sunans of Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah, it is recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to begin his late night prayer by declaring Allah's greatness ten times, praising Allah ten times, glorifying Allah ten times, and seeking Allah's forgiveness ten times. Then he would say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي وَاهْدِنِي وَارْزُقْنِي وَعَافِنِي»</p><p>(O Allah! Forgive me, guide me, provide for me, and protect me.) Then he would seek refuge from the hardship of the standing on the Day of Judgement.</p>"

Truly, the Record of the wicked is in Sijjin.) meaning, that their final destination and their abode will be in Sijjin, which is derived from the word prison (Sijn), and here it means straitened circumstances. Thus, Allah expresses the greatness of this matter, saying;</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سِجِّينٌ</p><p>(And what will make you know what Sijjin is) meaning, it is a great matter, an eternal prison, and a painful torment. Some have said that it is beneath the seventh earth. It has been mentioned previously in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara' bin `Azib that the Prophet said,</p><p>«يَقُول اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فِي رُوحِ الْكَافِرِ اكْتُبُوا كِتَابَهُ فِي سِجِّينٍ. وَسِجِّينٌ هِيَ تَحْتُ الْأَرْضِ السَّابِعَة»</p><p>(Allah says concerning the soul of the disbeliever, `Record his book in Sijjin.' And Sijjin is beneath the seventh earth.)"" it is known that the destination of the wicked people will be Hell, and it is the lowest of the low. For Allah says,</p><p>ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَـهُ أَسْفَلَ سَـفِلِينَ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low.

(25:13) Then Allah says,</p><p>كِتَـبٌ مَّرْقُومٌ</p><p>(A Register inscribed.) This is not an explanation of His statement,</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سِجِّينٌ</p><p>(And what will make you know what Sijjin is) It is only an explanation of the destination that will be recorded for them, which is Sijjin. Meaning, it is inscribed, written, and completed. No one can add to it and no one can remove anything from it. This was said by Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. Then Allah said,</p><p>وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Woe, that Day, to those who deny.) meaning, when they come to the imprisonment, Allah threatened them with, on the Day of Judgement, and the disgraceful torment. The statement, ""Woe,"" has already been discussed previously and there is no need to repeat it here. Basically, it means destruction and devastation. This is like what is said, ""Woe to so-and-so."" This is similar to what has been recorded in the Musnad and the Sunan collections on the authority of Bahz bin Hakim bin Mu`awiyah bin Haydah,</p><p>َ مَا سِجِّينٌ</p><p>(Nay! Truly, !

This is similar to what has been recorded in the Musnad and the Sunan collections on the authority of Bahz bin Hakim bin Mu`awiyah bin Haydah, who reported from his father, who reported from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَيْلٌ لِلَّذِي يُحَدِّثُ فَيَكْذِبُ لِيُضْحِكَ النَّاسَ، وَيْلٌ لَهُ وَيْلٌ لَه»</p><p>(Woe unto whoever speaks, and lies in order to make the people laugh. Woe unto him, woe unto him.) Then Allah says, in explaining who are the wicked, disbelieving deniers,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِيَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p><p>(Those who deny the Day of Recompense.) meaning, they do not believe it will happen, and they do not believe in its existence. Thus, they consider it a matter that is farfetched. Allah then says,</p><p>وَمَا يُكَذِّبُ بِهِ إِلاَّ كُلُّ مُعْتَدٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(And none can deny it except every transgressor, sinner.) meaning, transgressive in his actions by doing that which is forbidden and exceeding the limits when acquiring the permissible. He is a sinner in his statements, because he lies whenever he speaks, he breaks his promises whenever he makes them, and he behaves in an abusive and wicked manner whenever he argues. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا قَالَ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: ""Tales of the ancients!"") meaning, whenever he hears the Words of Allah from the Messenger , he denies it and has ill thoughts about it. Thus, he believes that it is a collection gathered from the books of the ancients. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ مَّاذَآ أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And when it is said to them: ""What is it that your Lord has sent down"" They say: ""Tales of the men of old!"")

(25:5) Then Allah continues saying,</p><p>كَلاَّ بَلْ رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.) meaning, the matter is not as they claim, nor as they say: ""Verily, this Qur'an is tales of the ancients."" Rather, it is the Word of Allah, His inspiration and His revelation to His Messenger . The only thing that blocked their hearts from believing in it is the dark covering cast over it from the many sins and wrong they committed that has covered up their hearts. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>كَلاَّ بَلْ رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.) This dark covering known as Rayn overcomes the hearts of the disbelievers, the covering of Ghaym is for the righteous, and the covering of Ghayn is for those who are near to Allah. Ibn Jarir, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisa'i, and Ibn Majah all recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ إِذَا أَذْنَبَ ذَنْبًا كَانَتْ نُكْتَةٌ سَوْدَاءُ فِي قَلْبِهِ، فَإِنْ تَابَ مِنْهَا صُقِلَ قَلْبُهُ، قu</p><p>uA ay!

If he repents from it, his heart is polished clean. However, if he increases (in the sin), the spot will continue to increase. That is the statement of Allah: ((Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.)) At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih.""

So, if he refrains from it, seeks forgiveness and repents, his heart is polished clean. But if he returns to the sin, the spot will increase until it overcomes his (entire) heart, and this is the Ran that Allah mentions when He says: (Nay, but on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.)) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ</p><p>(Nay! Surely, they will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.) meaning, they will have a place on the Day of Judgement, and lodging in Sijjin. Along with this they will be veiled from seeing their Lord and Creator on the Day of Judgement. Imam Abu `Abdullah Ash-Shafi`i said, ""In this Ayah is a proof that the believers will see Him (Allah), the Mighty and Sublime, on that Day."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُمَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَصَالُواْ الْجَحِيمِ</p><p>(Then verily, they will indeed enter the burning flame of Hell.) meaning, along with this being prevented from seeing the Most Gracious, they will also be among the people of the Fire.</p><p>ثُمَّ يُقَالُ هَـذَا الَّذِى كُنتُمْ بِهِ تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(Then, it will be said to them: ""This is what you used to deny!"")

Then when he completed the prayer, he informed them that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prostrated during its recitation. This was recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i on the authority of Malik. Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Rafi` that he prayed the Night prayer with Abu Hurayrah) recited,</p><p>إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ</p><p>(When the heaven is split asunder.) then he prostrated. So Abu Rafi` said something to him about it (questioning it). Abu Hurayrah replied, ""I prostrated behind Abul-Qasim (the Prophet ), and I will never cease prostrating during its recitation until I meet him.""</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Splitting the Heavens asunder and stretching the Earth forth on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ</p><p>(When the heaven is split asunder,) This refers to the Day of Judgement.</p><p>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا</p><p>(And listens to and obeys its Lord) meaning, it listens to its Lord and obeys His command to split apart. This will occur on the Day of Judgement.</p><p>وَحُقَّتْ</p><p>(and it must do so.) meaning, it is right for it to obey the command of its Lord, because it is great and cannot be rejected, nor overcome. Rather it overpowers everything and everything is submissive to it. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا الاٌّرْضُ مُدَّتْ</p><p>(And when the earth is stretched forth,) meaning, when the earth is expanded, spread out and extended. Then He says,</p><p>وَأَلْقَتْ مَا فِيهَا وَتَخَلَّتْ</p><p>(And has cast out all that was in it and became empty.) meaning, it throws out the dead inside of it, and it empties itself of them. This was said by Mujahid, Sa`id, and Qatadah.</p><p>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ</p><p>(And listens to and obeys its Lord, and it must do so.) The explanation of this is the same as what has preceded.</p><h2>The Recompense for Deeds is True</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الإِنسَـنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَدْحاً</p><p>(O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) meaning, `verily you are hastening to your Lord and working deeds.'</p><p>فَمُلَـقِيهِ</p><p>(and you will meet.) `Then you will meet that which you did of good or evil.' A proof for this is what Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded from Jabir, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ، وَأَحْبِبْ (مَنْ) شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مُلَاقِيه»</p><p>(Jibril said, ""O Muhammad! Live how you wish, for verily you will die; love what you wish, for verily you will part with it; and do what you wish, for verily you will meet it (your deed).) There are some people who refer the pronoun back to the statement ""your Lord."" Thus, they hold the Ayah to mean, ""and you will meet your Lord."" This means that He will reward you for your work, and pay you for your efforts. Therefore, both of these two views are connected. Al-`Awfi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said explaining,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الإِنسَـنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَدْحاً</p><p>(O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) ""Whatever deed you do, you will meet Allah with it, whether it is good or bad.""</p><h2>The Presentation and the Discussion that will take place during the Reckoning</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ - فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً</p><p>(Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning,) (84:7-8) meaning, easy without any difficulty. This means that he will not be investigated for all the minute details of his deeds. For verily, whoever is reckoned like that, he will certainly be destroyed. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ عُذِّب»</p><p>(Whoever is interrogated during the reckoning, then he will be punished.) `A'ishah then said, ""But didn't Allah say,</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً</p><p>(He surely will receive an easy reckoning,)"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«لَيْسَ ذَاكِ بِالْحِسَابِ، وَلَــكِنْ ذلِكِ الْعَرْضُ، مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عُذِّب»</p><p>(That is not during to the Reckoning, rather it is referring to the presentation. Whoever is interrogated during the Reckoning on the Day of Judgement, then he will be punished.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً</p><p>(And will return to his family Masrur!) This means that he will return to his family in Paradise. This was said by Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. They also said, ""Masrur means happy and delighted by what Allah has given him."" Allah said;</p><p>وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ</p><p>(But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,) meaning, he will be given his Book in his left hand, behind his back, while his hand is bent behind him.</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُوراً</p><p>(He will invoke destruction,) meaning, loss and destruction.</p><p>وَيَصْلَى سَعِيراً - إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً</p><p>(And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning. Verily, he was among his people in joy!) meaning, happy. He did not think about the consequences, nor feared what (future) was in front of him. His light happiness will be followed by long grief.</p><p>إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ</p><p>(Verily, he thought that he would never return!) meaning, he used to believe that he would not return to Allah, nor would Allah bring him back (to life) after his death. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. Allah then says,</p><p>بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً</p><p>(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) meaning, certainly Allah will repeat his creation just as he began his creation, and He will reward him based upon his deeds, whether they were good or bad. He was ever watchful of him, meaning All-Knowing and All-Aware.</p>"

(25:61) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, ""Al-Buruj are the stars."" Al-Minhal bin `Amr said,</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ الْبُرُوجِ</p><p>(By the heaven holding the Buruj.) ""The beautiful creation.""

He does not seek refuge from any evil in it except that Allah will protect him. (And by the Witnessed.)( This refers to the day of `Arafah (in Hajj).) Ibn Khuzaymah also recorded the same Hadith. It has also been recorded as a statement of Abu Hurayrah and it is similar (to this Hadith).</p><h2>Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>قُتِلَ أَصْحَـبُ الاٍّخْدُودِ</p><p>(Cursed were (Qutila) the People of the Ditch (Ukhdud).) meaning, the companions of the Ukhdud were cursed. The plural of Ukhdud is Akhadid, which means ditches in the ground. This is information about a group of people who were among the disbelievers. They went after those among them who believed in Allah and they attempted to force them to give up their religion. However, the believers refused to recant, so they dug a ditch for them in the ground. Then they lit a fire in it and prepared some fuel for it in order to keep it ablaze. Then they tried to convince them (the believers) to apostate from their religion (again), but they still refused them. So they threw them into the fire. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>قُتِلَ أَصْحَـبُ الاٍّخْدُودِ - النَّارِ ذَاتِ الْوَقُودِ - إِذْ هُمْ عَلَيْهَا قُعُودٌ - وَهُمْ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ شُهُودٌ</p><p>(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers.) meaning, they were witnesses to what was done to these believers. Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا نَقَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ</p><p>(And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise!) meaning, they did not commit any sin according to these people, except for their faith in Allah the Almighty, Who does not treat unjustly those who desire to be with Him. He is the Most Mighty and Most Praiseworthy in all of His statements, actions, legislation, and decrees. He decreed what happened to these servants of His at the hands of the disbelievers - and He is the Most Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy - even though the reason for this decree is unknown to many people. Then Allah says,</p><p>الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth!) Among His perfect Attributes is that He is the Owner of all of the heavens, the earth, whatever is in them, and whatever is between them.</p><p>وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p><p>(And Allah is Witness over everything.) meaning, nothing is concealed from Him in all of the heavens and the earth, nor is anything hidden from Him.</p><h2>The Story of the Sorcerer, the Monk, the Boy and Those Who were forced to enter the Ditch</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَانَ فِيمَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ مَلِكٌ وَكَانَ لَهُ سَاحِرٌ، فَلَمَّا كَبِرَ السَّاحِرُ قَالَ لِلْمَلِكِ: إِنِّي قَدْ كَبُرَ سِنِّي وَحَضَرَ أَجَلِي، فَادْفَعْ إِلَيَّ غُلَامًا لِأُعَلِّمَهُ السِّحْرَ، فَدَفَعَ إِلَيْهِ غُلَامًا فَكَانَ يُعَلِّمُهُ السِّحْرَ، وَكَانَ الْغُلَامُ عَلَى الرَّاهِبِ فَسَمِعَ مِنْ كَلَامِهِ فَأَعْجَبَهُ نَحْوُهُ وَكَلَامُهُ، وَكَانَ إِذَا أَتَى السَّاحِرَ ضَرَبَهُ وَقَالَ: مَا حَبَسَكَ؟ وَإِذَا أَتَى أَهْلَهُ ضَرَبُوهُ وَقَالُوا: مَا حَبَسَكَ؟ فَشَكَا ذلِكَ إِلَى الرَّاهِبِ فَـقَالَ: إِذَا أَرَادَ السَّاحِرُ أَنْ يَضْرِبَكَ فَقُلْ: حَبَسَنِي أَهْلِي، وَإِذَا أَرَادَ أَهْلُكَ أَنْ يَضْرِبُوكَ فَقُلْ: حَبَسَنِي السَّاحِرُ، قَالَ: فَبَيْنَمَا هُوَ ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ إِذْ أَتَى عَلَى دَابَّةٍ فَظِيعَةٍ عَظِيمَةٍ قَدْ حَبَسَتِ النَّاسَ فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ أَنْ يَجُوزُوا. فَقَالَ: الْيَوْمَ أَعْلَمُ أَمْرُ الرَّاهِبِ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ أَمْ أَمْرُ السَّاحِرِ؟ قَالَ فَأَخَذَ حَجَرًا فَـقَالَ: اللْهُمَّ إِنْ كَانَ أَمْرُ الرَّاهِبِ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكَ وَأَرْضَى مِنْ أَمْرِ السَّاحِرِ فَاقْتُلْ هذِهِ الدَّابَّةَ حَتْى يَجُوزَ النَّاسُ، ورَمَاهَا فَقَتَلَهَا وَمَضَى النَّاسُ.</p><p>(Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, ""I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic."" So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, ""Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.' And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.""' So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, ""Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better."" So, he took a stone and said, ""O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road)."" Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p><p>فَأَخْبَرَ الرَّاهِبَ بِذلِكَ فَـقَالَ: أَيْ بُنَيَّ، أَنْتَ أَفْضَلُ مِنِّي وَإِنَّكَ سَتُبْتَلَى، فَإِنِ ابْتُلِيتَ فَلَا تَدُلَّ عَلَيَّ، فَكَانَ الْغُلَامُ يُبْرِىءُ الْأَكْمَهَ وَالْأَبْرَصَ وَسَائِرَ الْأَدْوَاءِ وَيَشْفِيهِمْ، وَكَانَ لِلْمَلِكِ جَلِيسٌ فَعَمِيَ فَسَمِعَ بِهِ فَأَتَاهُ بِهَدَايَا كَثِيرَةٍ فَقَالَ: اشْفِنِي وَلَكَ مَا ههُنَا أَجْمَعُ، فَـقَالَ: مَا أَنَا أَشْفِي أَحَدًا، إِنَّمَا يَشْفِي اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، فَإِنْ آمَنْتَ بِهِ دَعَوْتُ اللهَ فَشَفَاكَ، فَآمَنَ فَدَعَا اللهَ فَشَفَاهُ.</p><p>The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, ""O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me."" The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, ""All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me."" The boy said, ""I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you."" So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p><p>ثُمَّ أَتَى الْمَلِكَ فَجَلَسَ مِنْهُ نَحْوَ مَا كَانَ يَجْلِسُ فَقَالَ لَهُ الْمَلِكُ: يَا فُلَانُ، مَنْ رَدَّ عَلَيْكَ بَصَرَكَ؟ فَـقَالَ: رَبِّي. فَـقَالَ: أَنَا؟ قَالَ: لَا، رَبِّي وَرَبُّكَ اللهُ، قَالَ: وَلَكَ رَبٌّ غَيْرِي؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكَ اللهُ، فَلَمْ يَزَلْ يُعَذِّبُهُ حَتْى دَلَّ عَلَى الْغُلَامِ، فَبَعَثَ إِلَيْهِ فَـقَالَ: أَيْ بُنَيَّ بَلَغَ مِنْ سِحْرِكَ أَنْ تُبْرِىءَ الْأَكْمَهَ وَالْأَبْرَصَ وَهذِهِ الْأَدْوَاءَ قَالَ: مَا أَشْفِي أَحَدًا إِنَّمَا يَشْفِي اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، قَالَ: أَنَا؟ قَالَ: لَا. قَالَ: أَوَلَكَ رَبٌّ غَيْرِي؟ قَالَ: رَبِّي وَرَبُّكَ اللهُ، فَأَخَذَهُ أَيْضًا بِالْعَذَابِ فَلَمْ يَزَلْ بِهِ حَتْى دَلَّ عَلَى الرَّاهِبِ فَأُتِيَ بِالرَّاهِبِ فَقَالَ: ارْجِعْ عَنْ دِينِكَ فَأَبَى، فَوَضَعَ الْمِنْشَارَ فِي مَفْرِقِ رَأْسِهِ حَتْى وَقَعَ شِقَّاهُ، وَقَالَ لِلْأَعْمَى: ارْجِعْ عَنْ دِينِكَ، فَأَبَى، فَوَضَعَ الْمِنْشَارَ فِي مَفْرِقِ رَأْسِهِ حَتْى وَقَعَ شِقَّاهُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ. وَقَالَ لِلْغُلَام: ارْجِعْ عَنْ دِينِكَ، فَأَبَى، فَبَعَثَ بِهِ مَعَ نَفَرٍ إِلى جَبَلِ كَذَا وَكَذَا وَقَالَ: إِذَا بَلَغْتُمْ ذُرْوَتَهُ فَإِنْ رَجَعَ عَنْ دِينِهِ وَإِلَّا فَدَهْدِهُوهُ، فَذَهَبُوا بِهِ فَلَمَّا عَلَوْا بِهِ الْجَبَلَ قَالَ: اللْهُمَّ اكْفِنِيهِمْ بِمَا شِئْتَ، فَرَجَفَ بِهِمُ الْجَبَلُ فَدُهْدِهُوا أَجْمَعُونَ، وَجَاءَ الْغُلَامُ يَتَلَمَّسُ حَتَّى دَخَلَ عَلَى الْمَلِكِ فَقَالَ: مَا فَعَلَ أَصْحَابُكَ؟ فَقَالَ: كَفَانِيهِمُ اللهُ تَعَالَى، فَبَعَثَ بِهِ مَعَ نَفَرٍ فِي قُرْقُورٍ فَقَالَ: إِذَا لَجَجْتُمْ بِهِ الْبَحْرَ فَإِنْ رَجَعَ عَنْ دِينِهِ، وَإِلَّا فَغَرِّقُوهُ فِي الْبَحْرِ، فَلَجَّجُوا بِهِ الْبَحْرَ فَـقَالَ الْغُلَامُ: اللْهُمَّ اكْفِنِيهِمْ بِمَا شِئْتَ، فَغَرِقُوا أَجْمَعُونَ.</p><p>Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, ""Who gave you back your sight"" The courtier replied, ""My Lord."" The king then said, ""I did"" The courtier said, ""No, my Lord and your Lord - Allah"" The king said, ""Do you have another Lord beside me"" The courtier said, ""Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah."" The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, ""O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases"" He said, ""I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure."" The king said, ""Me"" The boy replied, ""No."" The king asked, ""Do you have another Lord besides me"" The boy answered, ""My Lord and your Lord is Allah."" So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, ""Abandon your religion."" The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, ""Abandon your religion."" He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, ""Abandon your religion."" He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, ""Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top."" They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, ""O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish."" So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, ""What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do"" The boy said, ""Allah saved me from them."" So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, ""If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him."" So, they took him out to sea and he said, ""O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish."" So they were all drowned in the sea.</p><p>وَجَاءَ الْغُلَامُ حَتْى دَخَلَ عَلَى الْمَلِكِ فَـقَالَ: مَا فَعَلَ أَصْحَابُكَ؟ فَقَالَ: كَفَانِيهِمُ اللهُ تَعَالَى ثُمَّ قَالَ لِلْمَلِكِ: إِنَّكَ لَسْتَ بِقَاتِلي حَتْى تَفْعَلَ مَا آمُرُكَ بِهِ، فَإِنْ أَنْتَ فَعَلْتَ مَا آمُرُكَ بِهِ قَتَلْتَنِي، وَإِلَّا فَإِنَّكَ لَا تَسْتَطِيعُ قَتْلِي، قَالَ: وَمَا هُوَ؟ قَالَ: تَجْمَعُ النَّاسَ فِي صَعِيدٍ وَاحِدٍ ثُمَّ تَصْلُبُنِي عَلَى جِذْع وَتَأْخُذُ سَهْمًا مِنْ كِنَانَتِي، ثُمَّ قُلْ: بِاسْمِ اللهِ رَبِّ الْغُلَامِ. فَإِنَّكَ إِذَا فَعَلْتَ ذلِكَ قَـتَلْتَنِـي. فَفَعَلَ وَوَضَعَ السَّهْمَ فِي كَبِدِ قَوْسِهِ ثُمَّ رَمَاهُ وَقَالَ: بِاسْمِ اللهِ رَبِّ الْغُلَامِ، فَوَقَعَ السَّهْمُ فِي صُدْغِهِ، فَوَضَعَ الْغُلَامُ يَدَهُ عَلَى مَوْضِع السَّهْم وَمَاتَ، فَـقَالَ النَّاسُ: آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ الْغُلَام. فَقِيلَ لِلْمَلِكِ: أَرَأَيْتَ مَا كُنْتَ تَحْذَرُ؟ فَقَدْ وَاللهِ نَزَلَ بِكَ، قَدْ آمَنَ النَّاسُ كُلُّهُمْ، فَأَمَرَ بِأَفْوَاهِ السِّكَكِ، فَخُدَّتْ فِيهَا الْأَخَادِيدُ وَأُضْرِمَتْ فِيهَا النِّيرَانُ، وَقَالَ: مَنْ رَجَعَ عَنْ دِينِهِ فَدَعُوهُ، وَإِلَّا فَأَقْحِمُوهُ فِيهَا، قَالَ: فَكَانُوا يَتَعَادُّونَ فِيهَا وَيَتَدَافَعُونَ، فَجَاءَتِ امْرأَةٌ بابْنٍ لَهَا تُرْضِعُهُ، فَكَأَنَّهَا تَقَاعَسَتْ أَنْ تَقَعَ فِي النَّارِ فَـقَالَ الصَّبِيُّ: اصْبِرِي يَا أُمَّاهْ فَإِنَّكِ عَلَى الْحَق»</p><p>Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, ""What did your companions do"" The boy replied, ""Allah, saved me from them."" Then he said to the king, ""You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me."" The king asked, ""And what is that"" The boy said, ""Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.' If you do this, you will be able to kill me."" So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, ""In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy."" The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, ""We believe in the Lord of the boy!"" Then it was said to the king, ""Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy)."" So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, ""Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire."" They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her, ""Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!"") Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, ""Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p><p>قُتِلَ أَصْحَـبُ الاٍّخْدُودِ - النَّارِ ذَاتِ الْوَقُودِ - إِذْ هُمْ عَلَيْهَا قُعُودٌ - وَهُمْ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ شُهُودٌ - وَمَا نَقَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ - الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p><p>(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.) (85:4-9)"" This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah -- that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis). We will mention a portion of this -- if Allah wills -- when we discuss the Tafsir of the Surah:</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَـبِ الْفِيلِ</p><p>(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant) (105:1)</p><h2>The Punishment of the People of the Ditch</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُواْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ</p><p>(Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women,) meaning, they burned (them). This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Abza.</p><p>ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُوبُواْ</p><p>(and then do not turn in repentance,) meaning, `they do not cease from what they are doing, and do not regret what they had done before.'</p><p>فَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ الْحَرِيقِ</p><p>(then they will have the torment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the burning Fire.) This is because the recompense is based upon the type of deed performed. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, ""Look at this generosity and kindness. These people killed Allah's Awliya' and He still invites them to make repentance and seek forgiveness.""</p>"

5932,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat At-Tariq</h2><p>An-Nasa'i recorded that Jabir said, ""Mu`adh lead the Maghrib prayer and he recited Al-Baqarah and An-Nisa'. So the Prophet said,</p><p>«أَفَتَّانٌ أَنْتَ يَا مُعَاذُ، مَا كَانَ يَكْفِيكَ أَنْ تَقْرَأَ بِالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَاهَا وَنَحْوِهَا؟»</p><p>(Are you putting the people to trial O Mu`adh! Was it not sufficient for you to recite As-Sama'i wat-Tariq, and Ash-Shamsi wa Duhaha, and something like them)</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Swearing by the Existence of Humanity surrounded by the Organized System of Allah</h2><p>Allah swears by the heaven and what He has placed in it of radiant stars. Thus, He says,</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءِ وَالطَّارِقِ</p><p>(By the heaven, and At-Tariq;) Then He says,</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ</p><p>(And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is) Then He explains it by His saying,</p><p>النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ</p><p>(The star of Ath-Thaqib.) Qatadah and others have said, ""The star has been named Tariq because it is only seen at night and it is hidden during the day."" His view is supported by what has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith that prohibits a man to come to his family Taruq. This means that he comes to them unexpectedly at nighttime. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>الثَّاقِبُ</p><p>(Ath-Thaqib.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""The illuminating."" `Ikrimah said, ""It is illuminating and it burns the Shaytan"" Then Allah says,</p><p>إِن كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَّمَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ</p><p>(There is no human being but has a protector over him.) meaning, every soul has a guardian over it from Allah that protects it from the calamities. This is as Allah says,</p><p>لَهُ مُعَقِّبَـتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(For Him, there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.) (13:11)</p><h2>How Man is created is a Proof of Allah's Ability to Return Him to Him</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>فَلْيَنظُرِ الإِنسَـنُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ</p><p>(So, let man see from what he is created!) This is alerting man to the weakness of his origin from which he was created. The intent of it is to guide man to accept (the reality of) the Hereafter, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he is also able to repeat it in the same way. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27) Then Allah says,</p><p>خُلِقَ مِن مَّآءٍ دَافِقٍ</p><p>(He is created from a water gushing forth.) meaning, the sexual fluid that comes out bursting forth from the man and the woman. Thus, the child is produced from both of them by the permission of Allah. Due to this Allah says,</p><p>يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ</p><p>(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) meaning, the backbone (or loins) of the man and the ribs of the woman, which is referring to her chest. Shabib bin Bishr reported from `Ikrimah who narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><p>يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ</p><p>(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) ""The backbone of the man and the ribs of the woman. It (the fluid) is yellow and fine in texture. The child will not be born except from both of them (i.e., their sexual fluids)."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّهُ عَلَى رَجْعِهِ لَقَادِرٌ</p><p>(Verily, He is Able to bring him back (to life)!) This means that He is able to return this man that is created from fluid gushed forth. In other words, He is able to repeat his creation and resurrect him to the final abode. This is clearly possible, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he surely is able to repeat it. Indeed Allah has mentioned this proof in more than one place in the Qur'an.</p><h2>On the Day of Judgement, Man will have no Power or Assistance</h2><p>In this regard Allah says,</p><p>يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ</p><p>(The Day when all the secrets will be examined.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement the secrets will be tested. This means that they will be exposed and made manifest. Thus, the secret will be made open and that which is concealed will be well known. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُرْفَعُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ يُقَالُ: هذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَان»</p><p>(Every betrayer will have a flag raised for him behind his back, and it will be said, `This is the betrayal of so-and-so, the son of so-and-so.') Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَمَا لَهُ</p><p>(Then he will have no) meaning, man on the Day of Judgement.</p><p>مِن قُوَّةٍ</p><p>(any power) meaning, within himself.</p><p>وَلاَ نَاصِرٍ</p><p>(nor any helper.) meaning, from other than himself. This statement means that he will not be able to save himself from the torment of Allah, and nor will anyone else be able to save him.</p>"

5949,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-A`la</h2><p>This Surah was revealed in Makkah before the migration to Al-Madinah. The proof of this is what Al-Bukhari recorded from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, that he said, ""The first people to come to us (in Al-Madinah) from the Companions of the Prophet were Mus`ab bin `Umayr and Ibn Umm Maktum, who taught us the Qur'an; then `Ammar, Bilal and Sa`d came. Then `Umar bin Al-Khattab came with a group of twenty people, after which the Prophet came. I have not seen the people of Al-Madinah happier with anything more than their happiness with his coming (to Al-Madinah). This was reached to such an extent that I saw the children and little ones saying, `This is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who has come.' Thus, he came, but he did not come until after I had already recited (i.e., learned how to recite)</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) (87:1) as well as other Surahs similar to it."" It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Mu`adh,</p><p>«هَلَّا صَلَّيْتَ بِــ</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى »</p><p>(Why didn't you recite ""Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,""; ""By the sun and its brightness,"" and ""By the night when it envelopes."") Imam Ahmad recorded from An-Nu`man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَـشِيَةِ</p><p>Surat Al-A`la (chapter 87) and Surat Al-Ghashiyh (chapter 88) in the two `Id prayers. If the `Id prayer fell on Friday, he would recite them in both prayers (`Id and Salat Al-Jumu`ah). Muslim also recorded this in his Sahih, as well as Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. The wording of Muslim and the Sunan compilers says, ""He used to recite</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَـشِيَةِ</p><p>Surat Al-A`la (chapter 87) and Surat Al-Ghashiyh (chapter 88) for the two `Ids and Jumu`ah. If they occurred on the same day, he would recite them in both of them."" In his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded on the authority of Ubayy bin Ka`b, Abdullah bin `Abbas, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abza, and the Mother of the believers, `A'ishah, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) and (Say: `O you who disbelieve.') and (Say: `He is Allah, the One.') `A'ishah added in her version that he would also recite the Mu`awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq and An-Nas).</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيم</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Command to pronounce Tasbih and its Response</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that whenever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) he would say,</p><p>«سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى»</p><p>(Glory to my Lord, the Most High.) Ibn Jarir recorded from Ibn Ishaq Al-Hamdani that whenever Ibn `Abbas would recite</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) he would say, ""Glory to my Lord, the Most High,"" and whenever he would recite</p><p>لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ</p><p>(I swear by the Day of Resurrection.) (75:1) and then reach the end of it</p><p>أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(Is not He able to give life to the dead) (75:40) he would say, ""Glory to You, of course."" Qatadah said,</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) ""It has been mentioned to us that whenever the Prophet of Allah used to recite it he would say,</p><p>«سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى»</p><p>(Glory to my Lord, the Most High.)""</p><h2>The Creation, the Decree, and the bringing forth of Vegetation</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى</p><p>(Who has created, and then proportioned it.) meaning, He created that which has been created, and He fashioned every creation in the best of forms. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى</p><p>(And Who has measured; and then guided.) Mujahid said, ""He guided man to distress and happiness, and he guided the cattle to their pastures."" This Ayah is similar to what Allah has said about Musa's statement to Fir`awn,</p><p>رَبُّنَا الَّذِى أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى</p><p>(Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.) (20:50) meaning, He decreed a set measure and guided the creation to it. This is just as is confirmed in Sahih Muslim on the authority of `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلَائِقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّمَواتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»</p><p>(Verily, Allah ordained the measure of all creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِى أَخْرَجَ الْمَرْعَى</p><p>(And Who brings out the pasturage,) meaning, all types of vegetation and crops.</p><p>فَجَعَلَهُ غُثَآءً أَحْوَى</p><p>(And then makes it dark stubble.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Dried up and altered."" It has been narrated that Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd, all made similar statements.</p><h2>The Prophet does not forget the Revelation</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>سَنُقْرِئُكَ</p><p>(We shall make you to recite,) meaning, `O Muhammad.'</p><p>فَلاَ تَنسَى</p><p>(so you shall not forget (it),) This is Allah informing and promising him (the Prophet ) that He will teach him a recitation that he will not forget.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ اللَّهُ</p><p>(Except what Allah may will.) Qatadah said, ""The Prophet did not forget anything except what Allah willed."" It has been said that the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>فَلاَ تَنسَى</p><p>(so you shall not forget,) is, ""do not forget"" and that which would be abrogated, is merely an exception to this. Meaning, `do not forget what We teach you to recite, except what Allah wills, which He removes and there is no sin on your leaving it off (not retaining it).' Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْجَهْرَ وَمَا يَخْفَى</p><p>(He knows what is apparent and what is hidden.) meaning, He knows what the creatures do openly and what they hide, whether it be statements or deeds. None of that is hidden from Him. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَنُيَسِّرُكَ لِلْيُسْرَى</p><p>(And We shall make easy for you the easy.) meaning, `We will make good deeds and statements easy for you, and We will legislate such Law for you that is easy, tolerant, straight and just, with no crookedness, difficulty or hardship in it.'</p><h2>The Command to remind</h2><p>Allah then says,</p><p>فَذَكِّرْ إِن نَّفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(Therefore remind in case the reminder profits.) meaning, remind where reminding is beneficial. From here we get the etiquette of spreading knowledge, that it should not be wasted upon those who are not suitable or worthy of it. The Commander of the believers, `Ali said, ""You do not tell people any statement that their intellects do not grasp except that it will be a Fitnah (trial) for some of them."" He also said, ""Tell people that which they know. Would you like for Allah and His Messenger to be rejected"" Allah said:</p><p>سَيَذَّكَّرُ مَن يَخْشَى</p><p>(The reminder will be received by him who fears,) meaning, `he whose heart fears Allah and who knows that he is going to meet Him, will receive admonition from what you convey to him, O Muhammad.'</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die nor live.) meaning, he will not die and thus be allowed to rest, nor will he live a life that is beneficial to him. Instead, his life will be harmful to him, because it will be the cause of his feeling of the pain of torment and various types of punishments what he is being punished with. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَمَّا أَهْلُ النَّارِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَهْلُهَا لَا يَمُوتُونَ وَلَا يَحْيَوْنَ، وَأَمَّا أُنَاسٌ يُرِيدُ اللهُ بِهِمُ الرَّحْمَةَ فَيُمِيتُهُمْ فِي النَّارِ فَيَدْخُلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّفَعَاءُ فَيَأْخُذُ الرَّجُلُ الضِّبَارَةَ فَيُنْبِتُهُمْ أو قال: يَنْبُتُونَ فِي نَهْرِ الْحَيَا، أو قال: الْحَيَاةِ، أو قال: الْحَيَوَانِ أو قال: نَهْرِ الْجَنَّةِ فَيَنْبُتُونَ نَبَاتَ الْحِبَّةِ فِي حَمِيلِ السَّيْل»</p><p>(Concerning the people of the Fire who are deserving of it, they will not die nor will they live. Regarding the people that Allah wants mercy for, He will cause them to die in the Fire. Then He will allow the intercessors to come to them, and a man will take his groups of supporters and plant them (or he said (they will be planted) in the River of Al-Haya (or he said (Al-Hayah, or Al-Hayawan, or Nahr Al-Jannah). Then they will sprout up like the sprouting of the seed on the moist bank of a flowing stream.) Then the Prophet said,</p><p>«أَمَا تَرَوْنَ الشَّجَرَةَ تَكُونُ خَضْرَاءَ، ثُمَّ تَكُونُ صَفْرَاءَ، ثُمَّ تَكُونُ خَضْرَاءَ؟»</p><p>(Haven't you all seen the tree that is green, then it turns yellow, then it turns green (again)) Abu Sa`id then said that some of those present said, ""It is as if the Prophet used to live in the desert wilderness (i.e., due to his parables of nature)."" Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَمَّا أَهْلُ النَّارِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَهْلُهَا فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يَمُوتُونَ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَوْنَ، وَلَــكِنْ أُنَاسٌ أو كما قال تُصِيبُهُمُ النَّارُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ أو قال: بِخَطَايَاهُمْ فَيُمِيتُهُمْ إِمَاتَةً حَتْى إِذَا صَارُوا فَحْمًا أُذِنَ فِي الشَّفَاعَةِ، فَجِيءَ بِهِمْ ضَبَائِرَ ضَبَائِرَ فَبُثُّوا عَلى أَنْهَارِ الْجَنَّةِ فَيُقَالُ:يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ أَفِيضُوا عَلَيْهِمْ، فَيَنْبُتُونَ نَبَاتَ الْحِبَّةِ تَكُونُ فِي حَمِيلِ السَّيْل»</p><p>(Concerning the people of the Fire who will be dwellers of it, they will not die in it nor will they live. However, there will be a group of people - or as he said -( whom the Fire will burn due to their sins - or he said - (their wrongdoings. So, He will cause them to die until they become burnt coal. Then the intercession will be allowed and they will be brought group after group, and they will be scattered over the rivers of Paradise. Then it will be said: ""O people of Paradise! Pour down upon them."" Then they will sprout like the growing of the seed that is upon the moist bank of the flowing stream."" Then, a man from among the people present said, ""It is as if the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to live in the desert wilderness."" Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p>"

Imam Malik recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Qays asked An-Nu`man bin Bashir, ""What else did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recite on Friday along with Surat Al-Jumu`ah"" An-Nu`man replied, ""Al-Ghashiyah (88)."" This narration has been recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Muslim and Ibn Majah.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Day of Judgement and what will happen to the People of the Fire during it Al-Ghashiyah is one of</h2><p>This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. It has been called this because it will overwhelm the people and overcome them. Allah then says,</p><p>وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ</p><p>(Some faces that Day will be Khashi`ah.) meaning, humiliated. This was said by Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas said, ""They will be humble but this action will be of no benefit to them."" Then Allah says,</p><p>عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ</p><p>(Laboring, weary.) meaning, they did many deeds and became weary in their performance, yet they will be cast into a blazing Fire on the Day of Judgement. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Burqani narrated from Abu `Imran Al-Jawni that he said, "" `Umar bin Al-Khattab passed by the monastery of a monk and he said: `O monk!' Then the monk came out, and `Umar looked at him and began to weep. Then it was said to him: `O Commander of the faithful! Why are you weeping' He replied: `I remembered the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book,</p><p>عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً</p><p>(Laboring, weary.

It is narrated that `Ikrimah and As-Suddi both said, ""Laboring in the worldly life with disobedience, and weariness in the Fire from torment and perdition."" Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said,</p><p>تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً</p><p>(They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah) meaning, hot with intense heat.</p><p>تُسْقَى مِنْ عَيْنٍ ءَانِيَةٍ</p><p>(They will be given to drink from a boiling (Aniyah) spring.) meaning, its heat has reached its maximum limit and boiling point. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ</p><p>(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""A tree from the Hellfire."" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-Jawza' and Qatadah, all said, ""It is Ash-Shibriq (a type of plant)."" Qatadah said, ""The Quraysh called it Ash-Shabraq in the spring and Ad-Dari` in the summer."" `Ikrimah said, ""It is a thorny tree which reaches down to the ground."" Al-Bukhari related that Mujahid said, ""Ad-Dari` is a plant that is called Ash-Shibriq. The people of the Hijaz call it Ad-Dari` when it dries, and it is poisonous."" Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah said,</p><p>لَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ</p><p>(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) ""This is Ash-Shibriq. When it dries it is called Ad-Dari`.""

He says,</p><p>وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ</p><p>(Faces that Day.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement.</p><p>نَّاعِمَةٌ</p><p>(will be joyful,) meaning, pleasure will be noticeable in them (those faces). This will only occur due to their striving. Sufyan said,</p><p>لِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ</p><p>(Glad with their endeavor.) ""They will be pleased with their deeds."" Then Allah says,</p><p>فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ</p><p>(In a lofty Paradise.) meaning, elevated and brilliant, secure in their dwellings.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) meaning, they will not hear in the Paradise that they will be in, any foolish word. This is as Allah says,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً إِلاَّ سَلَـماً</p><p>(They shall not hear therein any Laghw, but only Salam.) (19:62) Allah also says,</p><p>لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ</p><p>(Free from any Laghw, and free from sin.) (52:23) and He says,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: ""Salam! Salam!"" ) (56:25-26) Then Allah continues,</p><p>فِيهَا عَيْنٌ جَارِيَةٌ</p><p>(Therein will be a running spring.) meaning, flowing freely. This is mentioned with the intent of emphasizing affirmation. It is not intended to mean that there is only one spring. So here it refers to springs collectively. Thus, the meaning is that in it (Paradise) are flowing springs. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ تَفَجَّرُ مِنْ تَحْتِ تِلَالِ أَوْ مِنْ تَحْتِ جِبَالِ الْمِسْك»</p><p>(The rivers of Paradise spring forth from beneath hills -- or mountains -- of musk.)</p><p>فِيهَا سُرُرٌ مَّرْفُوعَةٌ</p><p>(Therein will be thrones raised high.) meaning, lofty, delightful, numerous couches, with elevated ceilings. Upon which will be seated wide-eyed, beautiful maidens. They have mentioned that whenever the friend of Allah wishes to sit on these lofty thrones, they (the thrones) will lower themselves for him.</p><p>وَأَكْوَابٌ مَّوْضُوعَةٌ</p><p>(And cups set at hand.) meaning, drinking containers that are prepared and presented for whoever among their masters (i.e., the people of Paradise) wants them.</p><p>وَنَمَارِقُ مَصْفُوفَةٌ</p><p>(And Namariq set in rows.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""An-Namariq are pillows."" This was also said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and others.

5994,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>Recitation of Surat Al-Fajr in the Prayer</h2><p>An-Nasa'i recorded a narration from Jabir that Mu`adh prayed a prayer and a man came and joined him in the prayer. Mu`adh made the prayer long, so the man went and prayed (alone) at the side of the Masjid, and then left. When Mu`adh was informed of this he said, ""(He is) a hypocrite."" He (Mu`adh) then informed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ of what happened. The Prophet then asked the young man (about it) and he replied, ""O Messenger of Allah! I came to pray with him, but he made the prayer too long for me. So I left him and prayed at the side of the Masjid. Then I went to feed my she-camel."" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then said,</p><p>«أَفَتَّانٌ يَا مُعَاذُ؟ أَيْنَ أَنْتَ مِنْ</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا</p><p>وَالْفَجْرِ</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى »</p><p>(Are you causing trouble Mu`adh Why don't you recite (`Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High'), (`By the sun and its brightness'), (`By the dawn'), (and (`By the night as it envelops'))</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p><h2>The Explanation of Al-Fajr and what comes after it</h2><p>Concerning Al-Fajr, it is well known that it is the morning. This was said by `Ali, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid and As-Suddi. It has been reported from Masruq and Muhammad bin Ka`b that Al-Fajr refers to the day of Sacrifice (An-Nahr) in particular, and it is the last of the ten nights. `The ten nights' refers to the (first) ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Zubayr, Mujahid and others among the Salaf and the latter generations. It has been confirmed in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْ أَيَّامٍ الْعَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ فِيهِنَّ مِنْ هذِهِ الْأَيَّام»</p><p>(There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these days.) meaning the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. They said, ""Not even fighting Jihad in the way of Allah"" He replied,</p><p>«وَلَا الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، إِلَّا رَجُلًا خَرَجَ بِنَفْسِهِ وَمَالِهِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَرْجِعْ مِنْ ذلِكَ بِشَيْء»</p><p>(Not even Jihad in the way of Allah; except for a man who goes out (for Jihad) with his self and his wealth, and he does not return with any of that.)</p><h2>Explanation of Night</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَسْرِ</p><p>(And by the night when it departs.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""When it goes away."" `Abdullah bin Zubayr said,</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَسْرِ</p><p>(And by the night when it departs.) ""As some parts of it remove other parts of it."" Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, and Malik who reported it from Zayd bin Aslam and Ibn Zayd, they all said;</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَسْرِ</p><p>(And by the night when it departs.) ""When it moves along."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>هَلْ فِى ذَلِكَ قَسَمٌ لِّذِى حِجْرٍ</p><p>(There is indeed in them sufficient proofs for men with Hijr!) meaning, for he who possesses intellect, sound reasoning, understanding and religious discernment. The intellect has only been called Hijr because it prevents the person from doing that which is not befitting of him of actions and statement. From this we see the meaning of Hijr Al-Bayt because it prevents the person performing Tawaf from clinging the wall facing Ash-Sham. Also the term Hijr Al-Yamamah (the cage of the pigeon) is derived from this meaning (i.e., prevention). It is said, ""Hajara Al-Hakim so-and-so (The judge passed a judgement preventing so-and-so),"" when his judgement prevents the person from his liberty (i.e., of freely utilizing his wealth). Allah says,</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(And they will say: ""Hijr Mahjur."") (25:22) All of these examples are different cases but their meanings are quite similar. The oath that is referred to here is about the times of worship and the acts of worship themselves, such as Hajj, Salah and other acts of worship that Allah's pious, obedient, servants who fear Him and are humble before Him, seeking His Noble Face, perform in order to draw nearer to Him.</p><h2>Mentioning the Destruction of `Ad</h2><p>After mentioning these people, and their worship and obedience, Allah says,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ</p><p>(Saw you not how your Lord dealt with `Ad) These were people who were rebellious, disobedient, arrogant, outside of His obedience, deniers of His Messengers and rejectors of His Scriptures. Thus, Allah mentions how He destroyed them, annihilated them and made them legends to be spoken of and an exemplary lesson of warning. He says,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ - إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ</p><p>(Saw you not how your Lord dealt with `Ad Iram of the pillars,) These were the first people of `Ad. They were the descendants of `Ad bin Iram bin `Aws bin Sam bin Nuh. This was said by Ibn Ishaq. They are those to whom Allah sent His Messenger Hud. However, they rejected and opposed him. Therefore, Allah saved him and those who believed with him from among them, and He destroyed others with a furious, violent wind.</p><p>سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَبْعَ لَيَالٍ وَثَمَـنِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُوماً فَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَى كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ - فَهَلْ تَرَى لَهُم مِّن بَاقِيَةٍ</p><p>(Which Allah imposed on them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so that you could see men lying overthrown, as if they were hollow trunks of date palms! Do you see any remnants of them) (69: 7-8) Allah mentioned their story in the Qur'an in more than one place, so that the believers may learn a lesson from their demise. Allah then says,</p><p>إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ</p><p>(Iram of the pillars.) This is an additional explanation that adds clarification who they actually were. Concerning His saying,</p><p>ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ</p><p>(of the pillars.) is because they used to live in trellised houses that were raised with firm pillars. They were the strongest people of their time in their physical stature, and they were the mightiest people in power. Thus, Hud reminded them of this blessing, and he directed them to use this power in the obedience of their Lord Who had created them. He said,</p><p>وَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً فَاذْكُرُواْ ءَالآءَ اللَّهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</p><p>(And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh and increased you amply in stature. So remember the graces from Allah so that you may be successful.)(7:69) Allah also said,</p><p>فَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً</p><p>(As for 'Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: ""Who is mightier than us in strength"" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them.) (41:15) And Allah says here,</p><p>الَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ</p><p>(The like of which were not created in the land) meaning, there had been none created like them in their land, due to their strength, power and their great physical stature. Mujahid said, ""Iram was an ancient nation who were the first people of `Ad."" Qatadah bin Di`amah and As-Suddi both said, ""Verily, Iram refers to the House of the kingdom of `Ad."" This latter statement is good and strong. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>الَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ</p><p>(The like of which were not created in the land) Ibn Zayd considered the pronoun of discussion here to refer to the pillars, due to their loftiness. He said, ""They built pillars among the hills, the likes of which had not been constructed in their land before."" However, Qatadah and Ibn Jarir considered the pronoun of discussion to refer to the tribe (of `Ad), meaning that there was no tribe that had been created like this tribe in the land - meaning during their time. And this latter view is the correct position. The saying of Ibn Zayd and those who follow his view is a weak one, because if He intended that, He would have said ""The like of which were not produced in the land."" But He said:</p><p>لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ</p><p>(The like of which were not created in the land.) Then Allah says,</p><p>وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُواْ الصَّخْرَ بِالْوَادِ</p><p>(And Thamud, who hewed (Jabu) rocks in the valley) meaning, they cut the rocks in the valley. Ibn `Abbas said, ""They carved them and they hewed them."" This was also said by Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd. From this terminology it is said (in the Arabic language), ""the hewing of leopard skin"" when it is torn, and ""The hewing of a garment"" when it is opened. The word `Jayb' (pocket or opening in a garment) also comes from Jabu. Allah says,</p><p>وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتاً فَـرِهِينَ</p><p>(And you hew in the mountains, houses with great skill.) (26:149)</p><h2>A Mention of Fir`awn</h2><p>Allah then says,</p><p>وَفِرْعَوْنَ ذِى الاٌّوْتَادِ</p><p>(And Fir`awn with Al-Awtad) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""Al-Awtad are the armies who enforced his commands for him."" It has also been said that Fir`awn used to nail their hands and their feet into pegs (Awtad) of iron that he would hang them from. A similar statement was made by Mujahid when he said, ""He used to nail the people (up) on pegs."" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi all said the same thing. Allah said,</p><p>الَّذِينَ طَغَوْاْ فِى الْبِلَـدِ - فَأَكْثَرُواْ فِيهَا الْفَسَادَ</p><p>(Who did transgress beyond bounds in the lands. And made therein much mischief.) meaning, they rebelled, were arrogant, and went about making corruption in the land, and harming the people.</p><p>فَصَبَّ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّكَ سَوْطَ عَذَابٍ</p><p>(So, your Lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment.) meaning, He sent down a torment upon them from the sky and caused them to be overcome by a punishment that could not be repelled from the people who were criminals.</p><h2>The Lord is Ever Watchful</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَبِالْمِرْصَادِ</p><p>(Verily, your Lord is Ever Watchful.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""He hears and He sees."" This means that He watches over His creation in that which they do, and He will reward them in this life and in the Hereafter based upon what each of them strove for. He will bring all of the creation before Him and He will judge them with justice. He will requit each of them with that which he deserves, for He is far removed from injustice and tyranny.</p>"

Khusayf reported from Mujahid;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِهَـذَا الْبَلَدِ </div><p>(Nay! I swear by this city;) ""The word ""La"" (Nay) refers to the refutation against them (Quraish). I swear by this city."" Shabib bin Bishr narrated from `Ikrimah, from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِهَـذَا الْبَلَدِ </div><p>(Nay! I swear by this city;) ""This means Makkah."" Concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَنتَ حِلٌّ بِهَـذَا الْبَلَدِ </div><p>(And you are free in this city.) he (Ibn `Abbas) said, ""O Muhammad! It is permissable for you to fight in it."" Similar was reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, `Atiyah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, ""Allah made it lawful (to fight in) for him (the Prophet ) for one hour of a day."" The meaning of what they have said was mentioned in a Hadith that is agreed- upon as being authentic. In it the Prophet said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«إِنَّ هَذَا الْبَلَدَ حَرَّمَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلَى يَوْم الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يُعْضَدُ شَجَرُهُ وَلَا يُخْتَلَى خَلَاهُ، وَإِنَّمَا أُحِلَّتْ لِي سَاعَةٌ مِنْ نَهَارٍ، وَقَدْ عَادَتْ حُرْمَتُهَا الْيَوْمَ كَحُرْمَتِهَا بِالْأَمْسِ، أَلَا فَلْيُبَلِّغِ الشَّاهِدُ الْغَائِب»</div><p>(Verily, Allah made this city sacred on the Day that He created the heavens and the earth. Therefore, it is sacred by the sanctity of Allah until the Day of Judgement. Its trees should not be uprooted, and its bushes and grasses should not be removed. And it was only made lawful for me (to fight in) for one hour of a day. Today its sanctity has been restored just as it was sacred yesterday. So, let the one who is present inform those who are absent.) In another wording of this Hadith, he said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«فَإِنْ أَحَدٌ تَرَخَّصَ بِقِتَالِ رَسُولِ اللهِ فَقُولُوا: إِنَّ اللهَ أَذِنَ لِرَسُولِهِ وَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لَكُم»</div><p>(So, if anyone tries to use the fighting of the Messenger (to conquer Makkah) as an excuse (to fight there), then tell him that Allah permitted it for His Messenger and He has not permitted it for you.) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَوَالِدٍ وَمَا وَلَدَ </div><p>(And by the begetter and that which he begot.) Mujahid, Abu Salih, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Khusayf, Shurahbil bin Sa`d and others have said, ""Meaning, by the begetter, Adam, and that which he begot is his children."" This view that Mujahid and his companions have chosen is good and strong. This is supported by the fact that Allah swears by the Mother of the Towns, which are dwellings. Then after it He swears by the dwellers therein, who is Adam, the father of mankind, and his children. Abu `Imran Al-Jawni said, ""It refers to Ibrahim and his progeny."" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement as did Ibn Abi Hatim. Ibn Jarir preferred the view that it is general and it refers to every father and his children. This meaning is also acceptable. Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ فِى كَبَدٍ </div><p>(Verily, We have created man in Kabad.) Ibn Abi Najih and Jurayj reported from `Ata, from Ibn `Abbas concerning the phrase `in Kabad', ""He was created while in hardship. Don't you see him"" Then he mentioned his birth and the sprouting of his teeth. Mujahid said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فِى كَبَدٍ</div><p>(in Kabad.) ""A drop of sperm, then a clot, then a lump of flesh, enduring in his creation."" Mujahid then said, ""This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ كُرْهاً وَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْهاً</div><p>(His mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship.) (46:15) and she breast-feeds him with hardship, and his livelihood is a hardship. So he endures all of this."" Sa`id bin Jubayr said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ فِى كَبَدٍ </div><p>(Verily, We have created man in Kabad.) ""In hardship and seeking livelihood."" `Ikrimah said, ""In hardship and long-suffering."" Qatadah said, ""In difficulty."" It is reported from Al-Hasan that he said, ""Enduring the hardships of the world by life and the severity of the Hereafter.""</p><h2>Man is encompassed by Allah and His Bounties</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَيَحْسَبُ أَن لَّن يَقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ أَحَدٌ </div><p>(Does he think that none can overcome him) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَيَحْسَبُ أَن لَّن يَقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ أَحَدٌ </div><p>(Does he think that none can overcome him) ""Meaning no one is able to take his wealth."" Qatadah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَيَحْسَبُ أَن لَّن يَقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ أَحَدٌ </div><p>(Does he think that none can overcome him) ""The Son of Adam thinks that he will not be asked about this wealth of his -- how he earned and how he spent it."" Allah said:</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَقُولُ أَهْلَكْتُ مَالاً لُّبَداً </div><p>(He says: ""I have wasted wealth in abundance!"") This means, the Son of Adam says, ""I spent an abundance of wealth."" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others have said this.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَيَحْسَبُ أَن لَّمْ يَرَهُ أَحَدٌ </div><p>(Does he think that none sees him) Mujahid said, ""Does he think that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not see him."" Others among the Salaf have said similar to this. Allah said;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ </div><p>(Have We not made for him two eyes) meaning, for him to see with them.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلِسَاناً</div><p>(And a tongue) meaning, for him to speak with, and so that he can express that which is inside of him.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَشَفَتَيْنِ</div><p>(and two lips) In order to help him with speaking, eating food, and beautifying his face and his mouth.</p><h2>The Ability to distinguish between Good and Evil is also a Blessing</h2><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَهَدَيْنَـهُ النَّجْدَينِ </div><p>(And shown him the two ways) This refers to the two paths.

Similar to this has been reported from `Ali, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Wa'il, Abu Salih, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, and `Ata' Al-Khurasani among others. Similar to this Ayah is Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَـهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً - إِنَّا هَدَيْنَـهُ السَّبِيلَ إِمَّا شَاكِراً وَإِمَّا كَفُوراً </div><p>(Verily, We have created man from Nutfah Amshaj, in order to try him: so We made him hearer and seer.

6044,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>Recitation of Surah Ash-Shams wa Duhaha in the `Isha' Prayer The Hadith of Jabir which was recorded in the Two Sahihs has already been mentioned. In it the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Mu`adh,</p><p>«هَلَّا صَلَّيْتَ بِــ</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى »</p><p>(Why didn't you pray with (the recitation of) (Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High) (87), (By the sun and Duhaha) (91), and (By the night as it envelops) (92))</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Allah swears by His Creation that the Person Who purifies Himself will be Successful and the Person Who corrupts Himself will fail</h2><p>Mujahid said,</p><p>وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا</p><p>(By the sun and Duhaha.) ""This means, by its light."" Qatadah said,</p><p>وَضُحَـهَا</p><p>(wa Duhaha.) ""The whole day."" Ibn Jarir said, ""The correct view is what has been said, `Allah swears by the sun and its daytime, because the clear light of the sun is daytime.""'</p><p>وَالْقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلـهَا</p><p>(By the moon as it Talaha.) Mujahid said, ""It follows it (the sun)."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><p>وَالْقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلـهَا</p><p>(By the moon as it Talaha.) ""It follows the day."" Qatadah said, ""`as it Talaha (follows it)' is referring to the night of the Hilal (the new crescent moon). When the sun goes down, the Hilal is visible."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّـهَا</p><p>(By the day as it Jallaha.) Mujahid said, ""When it illuminates."" Thus, Mujahid said,</p><p>وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّـهَا</p><p>(By the day as it Jallaha.) ""This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى</p><p>(By the day as it Tajalla.) (92:2)"" And they have said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَـهَا</p><p>(By the night as it Yaghshaha.) meaning, when it covers the sun, which takes place when sun disappears and the horizons become dark. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءِ وَمَا بَنَـهَا</p><p>(By the heaven and Ma Banaha.) The meaning here could be for descriptive purposes, meaning ""By the heaven and its construction."" This was said by Qatadah. It could also mean ""By the heaven and its Constructor."" This was stated by Mujahid. Both views are interrelated, and construction means raising. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ</p><p>(With Hands did We construct the heaven.) (51:47) meaning, with strength.</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ - وَالاٌّرْضَ فَرَشْنَـهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَـهِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We are able to extend the vastness of space thereof. And We have spread out the earth: how excellent a spreader are We!) (51:47-48) This is also similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا طَحَـهَا</p><p>(By the earth and Ma Tahaha.) Mujahid said, ""Tahaha means He spread it out."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><p>وَمَا طَحَـهَا</p><p>(and Ma Tahaha.) ""This means what He created in it."" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""Tahaha means that He proportioned it."" Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri, Abu Salih and Ibn Zayd all said that</p><p>طَحَـهَا</p><p>(Tahaha) means, He spread it out. Allah then says,</p><p>وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا</p><p>(By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it).) meaning, He created it sound and well-proportioned upon the correct nature (Al-Fitrah). This is as Allah says,</p><p>فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفاً فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(So set you your face towards the religion, Hanif. Allah's Fitrah with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in the Khalqillah.) (30:30) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلى الْفِطْرَةِ فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ، كَمَا تُولَدُ الْبَهِيمَةُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ، هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاءَ؟»</p><p>(Every child that is born, is born upon the Fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Zoroastrian. This is just as the animal is born, complete with all of its parts. Do you notice any mutilation in it) Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah. In Sahih Muslim, it has been narrated from `Iyad bin Himar Al-Mujashi`i that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ فَجَاءَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِم»</p><p>(Allah the Mighty and Majestic says, ""Verily I created My servants Hunafa' (as monotheists), but then the devils came to them and distracted them from their religion.)"" Then Allah says,</p><p>فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p>(Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.) meaning, He showed him to his transgression and his Taqwa. This means that He clarified that for it and He guided it to what has been ordained for him. Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p>(Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.) ""He explained the good and the evil to it (the soul)."" Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ath-Thawri all said the same. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, ""He gave him inspiration (to see what was) good and evil."" Ibn Zayd said, ""He made its Fujur and its Taqwa inside of it."" Ibn Jarir recorded from Abul-Aswad Ad-Dili that he said, ""`Imran bin Husayn said to me, `Do you think that what the people do, and what they strive for is a thing that is pre-ordained and predestined for them, or is it a thing which is only written after the Message comes to them from the Prophet , when there will be an evidence against them' I said, `Rather it is something preordained upon them.' Then he said, `Is that an injustice' Then I became extremely frightened of him (due to what he was saying), and I said to him, `There is nothing except that He (Allah) created it and possesses it in His Hand. He is not asked about what He does, while they (His creation) will be asked.' He (`Imran) then said, `May Allah guide you! I only asked you about that in order to inform you that a man from Muzaynah or Juhaynah tribe came to the Allah's Messenger ﷺ and asked him: ""O Messenger of Allah! Do you consider the actions of mankind and their struggles to be preordained for them and written for them from Qadr, or something written for them only after the Message came to them from their Prophet, when there will be an evidence against them"" He (the Prophet ) replied:</p><p>«بَلْ شَيْءٌ قَدْ قُضِيَ عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Rather it is something preordained for them.) So the man said, ""Then what is the point of our actions"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«مَنْ كَانَ اللهُ خَلَقَهُ لإِحْدَى الْمَنْزِلَتَيْنِ يُهَيِّئُهُ لَهَا، وَتَصْدِيقُ ذَلِكَ فِي كِتَابِ اللهِ تَعَالَى:</p><p>وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا - فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا »</p><p>(Whoever Allah created for one of the two positions (Paradise or Hell), He makes it easy for him (to attain). The proof of that is in the Book of Allah (By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it). Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa).)"" Ahmad and Muslim both recorded this Hadith. Allah then says,</p><p>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا</p><p>(Indeed he succeeds who purifies it. And indeed he fails who Dassaha.) This could mean that whoever purifies himself by obedience to Allah, then he will be successful. This is as Qatadah said, ""He cleanses it from the lowly and despicable characteristics."" Similar to this has been reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Sa`id bin Jubayr.</p><p>وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا</p><p>(And indeed he fails who Dassaha.) meaning, to conceal it. This means that he makes it dull, and he disregards it by neglecting to allow it to receive guidance. He treats it in this manner until he performs acts of disobedience and he abandons obedience of Allah. It also could mean that he is indeed successful whose soul Allah purifies, and he has failed whose soul Allah corrupts. This is like what was reported by Al-`Awfi and `Ali bin Abi Talhah from Ibn `Abbas. At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to stop whenever he recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا - فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p>(By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it). Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.) Then he would say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ آتِ نَفْسِي تَقْوَاهَا، أَنْتَ وَلِيُّهَا وَمَوْلَاهَا، وَخَيْرُ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا»</p><p>(O Allah! Give my soul its good. You are its Guardian and Master, and the best to purify it.)"" Another Hadith Imam Ahmad recorded that Zayd bin Arqam said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْعَجْز وَالْكَسَلِ، وَالْهَرَمِ وَالْجُبْنِ وَالْبُخْلِ وَعَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ. اللْهُمَّ آتِ نَفْسِي تَقْوَاهَا، وَزَكِّهَا أَنْتَ خَيْرُ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا، أَنْتَ وَلِيُّهَا وَمَوْلَاهَا. اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ قَلْبٍ لَا يَخْشَعُ، وَمِنْ نَفْسٍ لَا تَشْبَعُ، وَعِلْمٍ لَا يَنْفَعُ، وَدَعْوَةٍ لَا يُسْتَجَابُ لَهَا»</p><p>(O Allah! Verily, I seek refuge with You from weakness, laziness, senility (of old age), cowardliness, stinginess and the torment of the grave. O Allah! Give my soul its good and purify it, for You are the best to purify it. You are its Guardian and Master. O Allah! Verily, I seek refuge with You from a heart that is not humble, a soul that is not satisfied, knowledge that does not benefit and a supplication that is not answered.) Zayd then said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to teach us these (words) and we now teach them to you."" Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p>"

6059,"<h2>The Recitation of Surat Al-Layl in the `Isha' Prayer</h2><p>The statement of the Prophet to Mu`adh has already preceded, where he said,</p><p>«فَهَلَّا صَلَّيْتَ ب</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى</p><p>وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا</p><p>وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى»</p><p>(Why did you not pray with (the recitation of) (Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High) (87), and (By the sun and Duhaha) (91), and (By the night as it envelops) (92))</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Swearing by the Diversity of Mankind in Their Efforts and informing of the Different Results of that</h2><p>Allah swears by saying:</p><p>الْلَّيْلَإِذَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(By the night as it envelops.) meaning, when it covers the creation with its darkness.</p><p>وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى</p><p>(By the day as it appears.) meaning, with its light and its radiance.</p><p>وَمَا خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى</p><p>(By Him Who created male and female.) This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><p>وَخَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَزْوَجاً</p><p>(And We have created you in pairs.) (78:8) It is also similar to saying,</p><p>وَمِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَا زَوْجَيْنِ</p><p>(And of everything We have created pairs.) (51:49) And just as these things that are being sworn by are opposites, likewise that which this swearing is about are opposing things. This is why Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى</p><p>(Certainly, your efforts and deeds are diverse. ) meaning, the actions of the servants that they have performed are also opposites and diverse. Therefore, there are those who do good and there are those who do evil. Allah then says,</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى</p><p>(As for him who gives and has Taqwa.) meaning, he gives what he has been commanded to give and he fears Allah in his affairs.</p><p>وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى</p><p>(And believes in Al-Husna.) meaning, in the compensation for that. This was said by Qatadah. Khusayf said, ""In the reward."" Then Allah says,</p><p>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى</p><p>(We will make smooth for him the path of ease.) Ibn `Abbas said, ""Meaning for goodness."" Thus, Allah says,</p><p>وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ</p><p>(But he who is greedy) meaning, with that which he has.</p><p>وَاسْتَغْنَى</p><p>(and thinks himself self-sufficient,) `Ikrimah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, ""This means he is stingy with his wealth and considers himself to be in no need of his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic."" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p><p>وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَى</p><p>(And denies Al-Husna.) meaning, the recompense in the abode of the Hereafter.</p><p>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى</p><p>(We will make smooth for him the path to evil.) meaning, the path of evil. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away, as they refused to believe therein for the first time, and We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly.) (6:110) And there are many Ayat with this meaning, proving that Allah rewards those who intend good with success, while whoever intends evil is abandoned, and all of this is in accordance with a preordained decree. There are also many Hadiths that prove this.</p><h2>The Narration of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Bakr that he said to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, ""O Messenger of Allah! Do we act according to what has already been decided, or is the matter just beginning (i.e., still undecided)"" He replied,</p><p>«بَلْ عَلَى أَمْرٍ قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنْه»</p><p>(Indeed it is according to what has already been decided.) Then Abu Bakr said, ""Then what (good) are deeds, O Messenger of Allah"" He replied,</p><p>«كُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَه»</p><p>(Everyone will find it easy to do such deeds that will lead him to what he was created for.)</p><h2>The Narration of `Ali</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded from `Ali bin Abi Talib that they (the Companions) were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at the cemetery of Baqi` Al-Gharqad for a funeral, when the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَقَدْ كُتِبَ مَقْعَدُهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَمَقْعَدُهُ مِنَ النَّار»</p><p>(There is none among you except that his place has already been written, a seat in Paradise and a seat in the Hellfire.) They said, ""O Messenger of Allah! Should we depend on this"" He replied,</p><p>«اعْمَلُوا ، فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَه»</p><p>(Perform deeds for everyone will have the deeds of what he was created for (Paradise or Hell) made easy for him.) Then he recited the Ayah</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى - وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى - فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى</p><p>(As for him who gives and has Taqwa, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease.)"" until the Ayah:</p><p>لِلْعُسْرَى</p><p>(the path to evil) He (Imam Al-Bukhari) also recorded another similar narration from `Ali bin Abi Talib in which he said, ""We were at a funeral in the cemetery of Baqi` Al-Gharqad when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came and sat down. So we came and sat around him and he had a stick with him. Then he bowed his head and he began to scratch the ground with his stick. He then said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ مَا مِنْ نَفْسٍ مَنْفُوسَةٍ إِلَّا كُتِبَ مَكَانُهَا مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ،وَإِلَّا قَدْ كُتِبَتْ شَقِيَّةً أَوْ سَعِيدَة»</p><p>(There is not anyone among you -- or is not a single soul (that has been created) -- except that his place has been written in Paradise or in the Fire, and it has been written that he will be miserable or happy.) A man said, ""O Messenger of Allah! Should we just depend on what has been written for us and give up performing deeds For whoever of us is of the people of happiness then he will be of the people of happiness, and whoever among us is of the people of misery then he will be of the people of misery."" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«أَمَّا أَهْلُ السَّعَادَةِ فَيُيَسَّرُونَ لِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ السَّعَادَةِ، وَأَمَّا أَهْلُ الشَّقَاءِ فَيُيَسَّرُونَ إِلَى عَمَلِ أَهْلِ الشَّقَاءِ، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ:</p><p>(Those people who are the people of happiness, they will have the deeds of the people of happiness made easy for them. And those people who are the people of misery, they will have the deeds of the people of misery made easy for them.) Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى - وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى - فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى - وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَى</p><p>وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَى- فَسَنُيَسّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى-»</p><p>(As for him who gives and has Taqwa, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). But he who is greedy and thinks himself self-sufficient, and belies Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path to evil.)) The other compilers of the Group have also recorded this Hadith.</p><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Umar that `Umar said, ""O Messenger of Allah! Do you think that the deeds that we do are a matter that is already predetermined or are they something just beginning or new"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«فِيمَا قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنْهُ، فَاعْمَلْ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ، فَإِنَّ كُلًّا مُيَسَّرٌ، أَمَّا مَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ السَّعَادَةِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْمَلُ لِلسَّعَادَةِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الشَّقَاءِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْمَلُ لِلشَّقَاء»</p><p>(It is something that has already been predetermined. Therefore, work deeds, O son of Al-Khattab! For verily, each person will have things made easy for him. So whoever is from the people of happiness, then he will work deeds for happiness, and whoever is from the people of misery, then he will work deeds for misery.)"" This Hadith has been recorded by At-Tirmidhi in the Book of Al-Qadar and he said ""Hasan Sahih."" Another Hadith Narrated by Jabir Ibn Jarir recorded from Jabir bin `Abdullah that he said, ""O Messenger of Allah! Are we performing deeds for something that has already been predetermined or is the matter based upon what we are just doing (now)"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«لِأَمْرٍ قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنْه»</p><p>(It is a matter that has been predetermined.) Then Suraqah said, ""Then what is the purpose of deeds"" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then said,</p><p>«كُلُّ عَامِلٍ مُيَسَّرٌ لِعَمَلِه»</p><p>(Everyone who does deeds will have his deeds made easy for him.) Muslim also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded from `Amir bin `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr that he said, ""Abu Bakr used to free servants upon their acceptance of Islam in Makkah. He used to free the elderly and the women when they accepted Islam. So his father said to him, `O my son! I see that you are freeing people who are weak. But if you freed strong men they could stand with you, defend you and protect you.' Abu Bakr replied, `O my father! I only want -- and I think he said -- what is with Allah.' Some people of my family have told me this Ayah was revealed about him:</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى - وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى - فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى</p><p>(As for him who gives and has Taqwa, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease.)"" Then Allah says,</p><p>وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى</p><p>(And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down) Mujahid said, ""This means when he dies."" Abu Salih and Malik said -- narrating from Zayd bin Aslam, ""When he goes down into the Fire.""</p>"

Then a woman came and said, `O Muhammad! I think that your devil has finally left you.' So Allah revealed,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالضُّحَى - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى - مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى </div><p>(By the forenoon. By the night when it darkens. Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you.)"" Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir, all recorded this Hadith. This Jundub (who narrated it) is Ibn `Abdullah Al-Bajali Al-`Alaqi. In a narration from Al-Aswad bin Qays, he said that he heard Jundub say that Jibril was slow in coming to the Messenger of Allah . So the idolators said, ""Muhammad's Lord has abandoned him."" So Allah revealed,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالضُّحَى - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى - مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى </div><p>(By the forenoon. By the night when it darkens.

Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""When the Qur'an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah , Jibril was delayed from coming to him for a number of days (on one occasion). Therefore, the Messenger of Allah was affected by this. Then the idolators began to say, `His Lord has abandoned him and hates him.' So Allah revealed,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَى </div><p>(Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you.)"" In this, Allah is swearing by the forenoon and the light that He has placed in it.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى </div><p>(By the night when it darkens (Saja).) meaning, it settles, darkens meaning, it settles, darkens and overcomes them. This was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Zayd and others. This is a clear proof of the power of the Creator of this (light) and that (darkness). This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى - وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى </div><p>(By the night as it envelops. By the Day as it appears.) (92:1-2) Allah also says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَالِقُ الإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ </div><p>((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak. He has appointed the night for resting, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. Such is the measuring of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.) (6:96) Allah then says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ</div><p>(Your Lord has neither forsaken you) meaning, `He has not abandoned you.'</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَمَا قَلَى</div><p>(nor hates (Qala) you.) meaning, `He does not hate you.'</p><h2>The Hereafter is Better Than This First Life</h2><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ الاٍّولَى </div><p>(And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present.) meaning, the abode of the Hereafter is better for you than this current abode. For this reason the Messenger of Allah used to be the most abstinent of the people concerning the worldly things, and he was the greatest of them in his disregard for worldly matters. This is well known by necessity from his biography. When the Prophet was given the choice at the end of his life between remaining in this life forever and then going to Paradise, or moving on to the company of Allah, he chose that which is with Allah over this lowly world. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""The Messenger of Allah was lying down on a straw mat and it left marks on his side. Then when he woke up he began to rub his side. So I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Will you allow us to spread something soft over this straw mat' He replied,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«مَالِي وَلِلدُّنْيَا، إِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُ الدُّنْيَا كَرَاكِبٍ ظَلَّ تَحْتَ شَجَرَةٍ ثُمَّ رَاحَ وَتَرَكَهَا»</div><p>(I have nothing to do with this world. The parable of me and this world is like a rider who rests in the shade of a tree, then he passes on and leaves it.)"" At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah both recorded this Hadith by way of Al-Mas`udi. At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih.""</p><h2>The Numerous Bounties of the Hereafter are waiting for the Messenger of Allah</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى </div><p>(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) meaning, in the final abode Allah will give him until He pleases him concerning his followers, and in that which He has prepared for him from His generosity. From this will be the River of Al-Kawthar, which will have domes of hollowed pearls on its banks, and the mud on its banks will be the strongest frangrance of musk, as will be mentioned. Imam Abu `Amr Al-Awza`i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""The Messenger of Allah was shown that which his Ummah would be blessed with after him, treasure upon treasure. So he was pleased with that.

This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from his route of transmission. This chain of narration is authentic to Ibn `Abbas, and statements like this can only be said from that which is Tawqif.</p><h2>The Numerous Bounties of the Hereafter are waiting for the Messenger of Allah</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى </div><p>(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) meaning, in the final abode Allah will give him until He pleases him concerning his followers, and in that which He has prepared for him from His generosity.

This chain of narration is authentic to Ibn `Abbas, and statements like this can only be said from that which is Tawqif.</p><h2>A Mention of some of Allah's Favors upon the Messenger Enumerating His favors upon His Messenger</h2><p>Allah says;</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً فَآوَى </div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan and gave you a refuge) This refers to the fact that his father died while his mother was still pregnant with him, and his mother, Aminah bint Wahb died when he was only six years old. After this he was under the guardianship of his grandfather, `Abdul-Muttalib, until he died when Muhammad was eight years old. Then his uncle, Abu Talib took responsibility for him and continued to protect him, assist him, elavate his status, honor him, and even restrain his people from harming him when he was forty years of age and Allah commissioned him with the prophethood. Even with this, Abu Talib continued to follow the religion of his people, worshipping idols. All of this took place by the divine decree of Allah and His decree is most excellent. Until Abu Talib died a short time before the Hijrah. After this (Abu Talib's death) the foolish and ignorant people of the Quraysh began to attack him, so Allah chose for him to migrate away from them to the city of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj among those who helped him (in Al-Madinah). Allah caused his Sunnah to be spread in the most perfect and complete manner. Then, when he arrived at their city, they gave him shelter, supported him, defended him and fought before him (against the enemies of Islam) -- may Allah be pleased with all of them. All of this was from Allah's protection for him, guarding over him and caring for him. Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلاًّ فَهَدَى </div><p>(He found you unaware and guided you) This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا</div><p>(And thus We have sent to you a Ruh from Our command. you knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith. But We have made it a light wherewith We guide whosoever of our servants We will...) (42:52) Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلاً فَأَغْنَى </div><p>(And He found you poor and made you rich) meaning, `you were poor having dependents, so Allah made you wealthy and independent of all others besides Him.' Thus, Allah combined for him the two positions: the one who is poor and patient, and the one who is wealthy and thankful. In the Two Sahihs it has been recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«لَيْسَ الْغِنَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ الْعَرَضِ، وَلَكِنَّ الْغِنَى غِنَى النَّفْس»</div><p>(Wealth is not determined by abundance of possessions, but wealth is the richness of the soul.) In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَرُزِقَ كَفَافًا وَقَنَّعَهُ اللهُ بِمَا آتَاه»</div><p>(Whoever accepts Islam, is provided with his basic needs, and Allah makes him content with what He has given him, then he will be successful.)</p><h2>How should this Bounty be responded to</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَأَمَّا الْيَتِيمَ فَلاَ تَقْهَرْ </div><p>(Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression.) meaning, `just as you were an orphan and Allah sheltered you, then do not oppress the orphan.' In other words, `do not humiliate him, scorn him or despise him. Rather, you should be kind and gentle to him.' Qatadah said, ""Be like a merciful father to the orphan.""</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَمَّا السَّآئِلَ فَلاَ تَنْهَرْ </div><p>(And repulse not the one who asks.) meaning, `just as you were astray and Allah guided you, then do not scorn the one who asks for knowledge seeking to be guided.' Ibn Ishaq said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَمَّا السَّآئِلَ فَلاَ تَنْهَرْ </div><p>(And repulse not the one who asks.) ""This means do not be oppressive, arrogant, wicked, or mean to the weak among Allah's servants."" Qatadah said, ""This means respond to the poor with mercy and gentleness.""</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ </div><p>(And procalim the grace of your Lord.) meaning, `just as you were poor and needy, and Allah made you wealthy, then tell about Allah's favor upon you.' Abu Dawud recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«لَا يَشْكُرُ اللهَ مَنْ لَا يَشْكُرُ النَّاس»</div><p>(Whoever is not thankful to the people, then he is not thankful to Allah.) At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith and he said, ""Sahih"". Abu Dawud recorded from Jabir that the Prophet said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«مَنْ أُبْلِيَ بَلَاءً فَذَكَرَهُ فَقَدْ شَكَرَهُ، وَمَنْ كَتَمَهُ فَقَدْ كَفَرَه»</div><p>(Whoever overcomes some test (i.e., calamity) and mentions it (to others), then he is indeed thankful. And whoever conceals it, then indeed he was ungrateful.) Abu Dawud was alone in recording this Hadith. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ad-Duha, and unto Allah is due all praise and thanks.</p>"

The Group has recorded this Hadith in their books.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Explanation of At-Tin and what comes after it</h2><p>Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that what is meant by At-Tin is the Masjid of Nuh that was built upon Mount Al-Judi. Mujahid said, ""It is this fig that you have.""</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالزَّيْتُونِ</div><p>(By Az-Zaytun.) Ka`b Al-Ahbar, Qatadah, Ibn Zayd and others have said, ""It is the Masjid of Jerusalem (Bayt Al-Maqdis)."" Mujahid and `Ikrimah said, ""It is this olive which you press (to extract the oil).""</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَطُورِ سِينِينَ </div><p>(By Tur Sinin.) Ka`b Al-Ahbar and several others have said, ""It is the mountain upon which Allah spoke to Musa.""</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَهَـذَا الْبَلَدِ الاٌّمِينِ </div><p>(By this city of security.) meaning Makkah. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ibn Zayd and Ka`b Al-Ahbar. There is no difference of opinion about this. Some of the Imams have said that these are three different places, and that Allah sent a Messenger to each of them from the Leading Messengers, who delivered the Great Codes of Law. The first place is that of the fig and the olive, which was Jerusalem, where Allah sent `Isa bin Maryam. The second place is Mount Sinin, which is Mount Sinai where Allah spoke to Musa bin `Imran. The third place is Makkah, and it is the city of security where whoever enters is safe. It is also the city in which Muhammad was sent. They have said that these three places are mentioned at the end of the Tawrah. The verse says, ""Allah has come from Mount Sinai - meaning the one upon which Allah spoke to Musa bin `Imran; and shined from Sa`ir - meaning the mountain of Jerusalem from which Allah sent `Isa; and appeared from the mountains of Faran - meaning the mountains of Makkah from which Allah sent `Isa; and appeared from the mountains of Faran - meaning the mountains of Makkah from which Allah sent Muhammad ."" Thus, He mentioned them in order to inform about them based upon their order of existence in time. This is why He swore by a noble place, then by a nobler place, and then by a place that is the nobler than both of them.</p><h2>Man becoming Lowly even though He was created in the Best Form</h2><p>and the Result of that Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ فِى أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ </div><p>(Verily, We created man in the best form.)

This was said by Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan, Ibn Zayd and others. Then after this attractiveness and beauty, their destination will be to the Hell-fire if they disobey Allah and belie the Messengers. This is why Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(Save those who believe and do righteous deeds.) Some have said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَـهُ أَسْفَلَ سَـفِلِينَ </div><p>(Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low.) ""This means decrepit old age."" This has been reported from Ibn `Abbas and `Ikrimah. `Ikrimah even said, ""Whoever gathers the Qur'an (i.e., he memorizes it all), then he will not be returned to decrepit old age."" Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation. Even if this was the meaning, it would not be correct to exclude the believers from this, because some of them are also overcome by the senility of old age. Thus, the meaning here is what we have already mentioned (i.e., the first view), which is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(By Al-`Asr. Verily man is in loss, except those who believe and perform righteous deeds.) (103:1-3) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Then they shall have a reward without end.) meaning, that will not end, as we have mentioned previously.

So what is it that makes you deny the final return in the Hereafter after you have known this' Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِأَحْكَمِ الْحَـكِمِينَ </div><p>(Is not the Allah the best of judges) meaning, `is He not the best of judges, Who does not oppress or do any injustice to anyone' And from His justice is that He will establish the Judgement, and He will give retribution to the person who was wronged in this life against whoever wronged him. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat wat-Tin waz-Zaytun and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"

He would not see any dream except that it would come true just like the (clearness of) the daybreak in the morning. Then seclusion became beloved to him. So, he used to go to the cave of Hira' and devote himself to worship there for a number of nights, and he would bring provisions for that. Then he would return to Khadijah and replenish his provisions for a similar number of nights. This continued until the revelation suddenly came to him while he was in the cave of Hira'. The angel came to him while he was in the cave and said, ""Read!"" The Messen- ger of Allah said,</p><p>«فَقُلْتُ: مَا أَنَا بِقَارِىء»</p><p>(I replied: ""I am not one who reads.) Then he said, ""So he (the angel) seized me and pressed me until I could no longer bear it. Then he released me and said: `Read!' So I replied: `I am not one who reads.' So, he pressed me a second time until I could no longer bear it. Then he released me and said:</p><p>اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ</p><p>(Read in the Name of your Lord who has created.) until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ</p><p>(That which he knew not. )"" So he returned with them (those Ayat) and with his heart trembling until he came (home) to Khadijah, and he said,</p><p>«زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي»</p><p>(Wrap me up, wrap me up!) So they wrapped him up until his fear went away. After that he told Khadijah everything that had happened (and said),</p><p>«قَدْ خَشِيتُ عَلَى نَفْسِي»</p><p>(I fear that something may happen to me.) Khadijah replied, ""Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your relatives, you speak the truth, you help the poor and the destitute, you serve your guests generously, and you help the deserving, calamity afflicted people."" Khadijah then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqah bin Nawfal bin Asad bin `Abdul-`Uzza bin Qusay, who, during the period of ignorance became a Christian and used to scribe the Scriptures in Arabic. He would write from the Injil in Hebrew as much as Allah willed for him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadijah said to him, ""O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew."" Waraqah asked, ""O my nephew! What have you seen"" Allah's Messenger ﷺ described what he saw. Waraqah said, ""This is An-Namus whom Allah had sent to Musa. I wish I was young and could live until the time when your people would drive you out."" Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked,</p><p>«أَوَ مُخْرِجِيَّ هُمْ؟»</p><p>(Will they drive me out) Waraqah replied in the affirmative and said, ""Anyone who came with something similar to what you have brought, was treated with hostility and enmity; and if I should remain alive till that day then I would firmly support you."" But Waraqah did not remain. He died and the revelation paused until Allah's Messenger ﷺ became sad according to what we were told. Due to this grief he set out a number of times with the intent of throwing himself from the mountain tops. However, every time he would reach the peak of a mountain to throw himself from it, Jibril would appear to him and say, ""O Muhammad! You are truly the Messenger of Allah ﷺ!"" Therefore, his worry would be eased, his soul would be settled and he would return (down from the mountain). Then, when the revelation did not come again for a long time, he set out as he had done before. So when he reached the peak of the mountain, Jibril appeared to him again and said to him the same as he had said before."" This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs by way of Az-Zuhri. We have already discussed this Hadith's chain of narration, its text and its meanings at length in the beginning of our explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari. Therefore, whoever would like to read it, it is researched there, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah. So the first thing that was revealed of the Qur'an were these noble and blessed Ayat. They are the first mercy that Allah bestowed upon His servants and the first bounty that Allah favored them with.</p><h2>The Honor and Nobility of Man is in His Knowledge</h2><p>These Ayat inform of the beginning of man's creation from a dangling clot, and that out of Allah's generosity He taught man that which he did not know. Thus, Allah exalted him and honored him by giving him knowledge, and it is the dignity that the Father of Humanity, Adam, was distinguished with over the angels. Knowledge sometimes is in the mind, sometimes on the tongue, and sometimes in writing with the fingers. Thus, it may be intellectual, spoken and written. And while the last (written) necessitates the first two (intellectual and spoken), the reverse is not true. For this reason Allah says,</p><p>اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ</p><p>(Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) There is a narration that states, ""Record knowledge by writing."" There is also a saying which states, ""Whoever acts according to what he knows, Allah will make him inherit knowledge that he did not know.""</p>"

Then Allah threatens, warns and admonishes him in His saying,</p><p>إِنَّ إِلَى رَبِّكَ الرُّجْعَى</p><p>(Surely, unto your Lord is the return.) meaning, `unto Allah is the final destination and return, and He will hold you accountable for your wealth, as to where you obtained it from and how did you spend it.'</p><h2>Scolding of Abu Jahl and the Threat of seizing Him</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><p>أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِى يَنْهَى - عَبْداً إِذَا صَلَّى</p><p>(Have you seen him who prevents. A servant when he prays) This was revealed about Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him. He threatened the Prophet for performing Salah at the Ka`bah. Thus, Allah firstly admonished him with that which was better by saying,</p><p>أَرَءَيْتَ إِن كَانَ عَلَى الْهُدَى</p><p>(Have you seen if he is on the guidance.) meaning, `do you think this man whom you are preventing is upon the straight path in his action, or</p><p>أَوْ أَمَرَ بِالتَّقْوَى</p><p>(Or enjoins Taqwa) in his statements Yet, you rebuke him and threaten him due to his prayer.' Thus, Allah says,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَعْلَم بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَرَى</p><p>(Knows he not that Allah sees) meaning, doesn't this person who is preventing this man who is following correct guidance know that Allah sees him and hears his words, and He will compensate him in full for what he has done Then Allah says by way of warning and threatening,</p><p>كَلاَّ لَئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ</p><p>(Nay!

Then He says,</p><p>نَاصِيَةٍ كَـذِبَةٍ خَاطِئَةٍ</p><p>(A lying, sinful forehead!) meaning, the forehead of Abu Jahl is lying in its statements and sinful in its actions.</p><p>فَلْيَدْعُ نَادِيَهُ</p><p>(Then let him call upon his council.) meaning, his people and his tribe. In other words, let him call them in order to seek help from them.</p><p>سَنَدْعُ الزَّبَانِيَةَ</p><p>(We will call out the guards of Hell!) `And they are the angels of torment. This is so that he may know who will win -- Our group or his group' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Abu Jahl said, `If I see Muhammad praying at the Ka`bah, I will stomp on his neck.' So this reached the Prophet , who said,</p><p>«لَئِنْ فَعَلَ لَأَخَذَتْهُ الْمَلَائِكَة»</p><p>(If he does, he will be seized by the angels.)"" This Hadith was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their Books of Tafsir. Likewise, it has been recorded by Ibn Jarir. Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir, all recorded it from Ibn `Abbas with the following wording: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was praying at the Maqam (prayer station of Ibrahim) when Abu Jahl bin Hisham passed by him and said, `O Muhammad! Haven't I prevented you from this' He threatened the Prophet and thus, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ became angry with him and reprimanded him. Then he said, `O Muhammad! What can you threaten me with By Allah, I have the most kinsmen of this valley with me in the large.' Then Allah revealed,</p><p>فَلْيَدْعُ نَادِيَهُ - سَنَدْعُ الزَّبَانِيَةَ</p><p>(Then let him call upon his council. We will call out the guards of Hell!)"" Ibn `Abbas then said, ""If he had called his people, the angels of torment would have seized him at that very instant."" At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih."" Ibn Jarir recorded from Abu Hurayrah that Abu Jahl said, ""Does Muhammad cover his face with dust (i.e., from prostration) while he is among you all"" They (the people) replied, ""Yes."" Then he said, ""By Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza, if I see him praying like this, I will stomp on his neck, and I will certainly put his face in the dust."" So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came and he began praying, which made it possible for Abu Jahl to stomp on his neck. Then the people became surprised at him (Abu Jahl) because he began retreating on his heels and covering himself with his hands. Then it was said to him, ""What's the matter with you"" He replied, ""Verily, between me and him is a ditch of fire, monsters and wings."" Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْ دَنَا مِنِّي لَاخْتَطَفَتْهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عُضْوًا عُضْوًا»</p><p>(If he had come near me, the angels would have snatched him limb by limb.) The narrator added; ""Allah revealed an Ayah, but I do not know whether it is concerning the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah or not:</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَيَطْغَى</p><p>(Nay! Verily, man does transgress.) to the end of the Surah."" Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Muslim, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Abi Hatim all recorded this Hadith.</p><h2>Amusement for the Prophet</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><p>كَلاَّ لاَ تُطِعْهُ</p><p>(Nay! Do not obey him.) meaning, `O Muhammad! Do not obey him in what he is forbidding from such as steadfastness in worship and performing worship in abundance. Pray wherever you wish and do not worry about him. For indeed Allah will protect you and help you, and He will defend you against the people.'</p><p>وَاسْجُدْ وَاقْتَرِب</p><p>(Fall prostrate and draw near (to Allah)!) This is just like what has been confirmed in the Sahih of Muslim on the authority of Abu Salih who reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَقْرَبُ مَا يَكُونُ الْعَبْدُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ وَهُوَ سَاجِدٌ، فَأَكْثِرُوا الدُّعَاء»</p><p>(The closest that a servant can be to his Lord is when he is in prostration.

It has also been mentioned previously that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to prostrate when he recited</p><p>إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ</p><p>(When the heaven is split asunder.) (84:1) and</p><p>اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ</p><p>(Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created.) (96:1) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqra' (Surat Al-`Alaq).

(44:3) This is the Night of Al-Qadr and it occurs during the month of Ramadan. This is as Allah says,</p><p>شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِى أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ</p><p>(The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an.) (2:185) Ibn `Abbas and others have said, ""Allah sent the Qur'an down all at one time from the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz) to the House of Might (Baytul-`Izzah), which is in the heaven of this world. Then it came down in parts to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ based upon the incidents that occurred over a period of twenty-three years."" Then Allah magnified the status of the Night of Al-Qadr, which He chose for the revelation of the Mighty Qur'an, by His saying,</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ - لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</p><p>(And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah ""When Ramadan would come, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would say,</p><p>«قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ، شَهْرٌ مُبَارَكٌ، افْتَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَيْكُمْ صِيَامَهُ، تُفْتَحُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَتُغْلَقُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَحِيمِ، وَتُغَلُّ فِيهِ الشَّيَاطِينُ، فِيهِ لَيْلَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ، مَنْ حُرِمَ خَيْرَهَا فَقَدْ حُرِم»</p><p>(Verily, the month of Ramadan has come to you all. It is a blessed month, which Allah has obligated you all to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are shackled. In it there is a night that is better than one thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its good, then he has truly been deprived.)"" An-Nasa'i recorded this same Hadith. Aside from the fact that worship during the Night of Al-Qadr is equivalent to worship performed for a period of one thousand months, it is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه»</p><p>(Whoever stands (in prayer) during the Night of Al-Qadr with faith and expecting reward (from Allah), he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)</p><h2>The Descent of the Angels and the Decree for Every Good during the Night of Al-Qadr</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</p><p>(Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord's permission with every matter.) meaning, the angels descend in abundance during the Night of Al-Qadr due to its abundant blessings. The angels descend with the descending of blessings and mercy, just as they descend when the Qur'an is recited, they surround the circles of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and they lower their wings with true respect for the student of knowledge. In reference to Ar-Ruh, it is said that here it means the angel Jibril. Therefore, the wording of the Ayah is a method of adding the name of the distinct object (in this case Jibril) separate from the general group (in this case the angels). Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</p><p>(with every matter.) Mujahid said, ""Peace concerning every matter."" Sa`id bin Mansur said, `Isa bin Yunus told us that Al-A`mash narrated to them that Mujahid said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</p><p>(There is peace) ""It is security in which Shaytan cannot do any evil or any harm."" Qatadah and others have said, ""The matters are determined during it, and the times of death and provisions are measured out (i.e., decided) during it."" Allah says,</p><p>فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</p><p>(Therein is decreed every matter of decree.) (44:4) Then Allah says,</p><p>سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</p><p>(There is peace until the appearance of dawn.) Sa`id bin Mansur said, ""Hushaym narrated to us on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who narrated that Ash-Sha`bi said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</p><p>- سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</p><p>(With every matter, there is a peace until the appearance of dawn.) `The angels giving the greetings of peace during the Night of Al-Qadr to the people in the Masjids until the coming of Fajr (dawn).""' Qatadah and Ibn Zayd both said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</p><p>(There is peace.) ""This means all of it is good and there is no evil in it until the coming of Fajr (dawn).""</p><h2>Specifying the Night of Decree and its Signs</h2><p>This is supported by what Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ فِي الْعَشْرِ الْبَوَاقِي، مَنْ قَامَهُنَّ ابْتِغَاءَ حِسْبَتِهِنَّ فَإِنَّ اللهَ يَغْفِرُ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ، وَهِيَ لَيْلَةُ وِتْرٍ: تِسْعٍ أَوْ سَبْعٍ أَوْ خَامِسَةٍ أَوْ ثَالِثَةٍ أَوْ آخِرِ لَيْلَة»</p><p>(The Night of Al-Qadr occurs during the last ten (nights). Whoever stands for them (in prayer) seeking their reward, then indeed Allah will forgive his previous sins and his latter sins. It is an odd night: the ninth, or the seventh, or the fifth, or the third or the last night (of Ramadan).) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ also said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَمَارَةَ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ أَنَّهَا صَافِيَةٌ بَلْجَةٌ، كَأَنَّ فِيهَا قَمَرًا سَاطِعًا، سَاكِنَةٌ سَاجِيَةٌ، لَا بَرْدَ فِيهَا وَلَا حَرَّ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِكَوْكَبٍ يُرْمَى بِهِ فِيهَا حَتْى يُصْبِحَ، وَإِنَّ أَمَارَتَهَا أَنَّ الشَّمْسَ صَبِيحَتَهَا تَخْرُجُ مُسْتَوِيَةً لَيْسَ لَهَا شُعَاعٌ، مِثْلَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ أَنْ يَخْرُجَ مَعَهَا يَوْمَئِذ»</p><p>(Verily, the sign of the Night of Al-Qadr is that it is pure and glowing as if there were a bright, tranquil, calm moon during it. It is not cold, nor is it hot, and no shooting star is permitted until morning. Its sign is that the sun appears on the morning following it smooth having no rays on it, just like the moon on a full moon night. Shaytan is not allowed to come out with it (the sun) on that day.) This chain of narration is good. In its text there is some oddities and in some of its wordings there are things that are objectionable. Abu Dawud mentioned a section in his Sunan that he titled, ""Chapter: Clarification that the Night of Al-Qadr occurs during every Ramadan."" Then he recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about the Night of Al-Qadr while I was listening and he said,</p><p>«هِيَ فِي كُلِّ رَمَضَان»</p><p>(It occurs during every Ramadan.)"" The men of this chain of narration are all reliable, but Abu Dawud said that Shu`bah and Sufyan both narrated it from Ishaq and they both considered it to be a statement of the Companion (Ibn `Umar, and thus not the statement of the Prophet ). It has been reported that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ performed I`tikaf during the first ten nights of Ramadan and we performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said, `That which you are seeking is in front of you.' So the Prophet performed I`tikaf during the middle ten days of Ramadan and we also performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said; `That which you are seeking is ahead of you.' So the Prophet stood up and gave a sermon on the morning of the twentieth of Ramadan and he said,</p><p>«مَنْ كَانَ اعْتَكَفَ مَعِيَ فَلْيَرْجِعْ فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ، وَإِنِّي أُنْسِيتُهَا، وَإِنَّهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ فِي وِتْرٍ، وَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ كَأَنِّي أَسْجُدُ فِي طِينٍ وَمَاء»</p><p>(Whoever performed I`tikaf with me, let him come back (for I`tikaf again), for verily I saw the Night of Al-Qadr, and I was caused to forget it, and indeed it is during the last ten (nights). It is during an odd night and I saw myself as if I were prostrating in mud and water.) The roof of the Masjid was made of dried palm-tree leaves and we did not see anything (i.e., clouds) in the sky. But then a patch of wind-driven clouds came and it rained. So the Prophet lead us in prayer until we saw the traces of mud and water on the forehead of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, which confirmed his dream."" In one narration it adds that this occurred on the morning of the twenty-first night (meaning the next morning). They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded it in the Two Sahihs. Ash-Shafi`i said, ""This Hadith is the most authentic of what has been reported."" It has also been said that it is on the twenty-third night due to a Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Unays in Sahih Muslim. It has also been said that it is on the twenty-fifth night due to what Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ فِي تَاسِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي سَابِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي خَامِسَةٍ تَبْقَى»</p><p>(Seek it in the last ten (nights) of Ramadan. In the ninth it still remains, in the seventh it still remains, in the fifth it still remains.) Many have explained this Hadith to refer to the odd nights, and this is the most apparent and most popular explanation. It has also been said that it occurs on the twenty-seventh night because of what Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ubay bin Ka`b that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned that it was on the twenty-seventh night. Imam Ahmad recorded from Zirr that he asked Ubayy bin Ka`b, ""O Abu Al-Mundhir! Verily, your brother Ibn Mas`ud says whoever stands for prayer (at night) the entire year, will catch the Night of Al-Qadr."" He (Ubayy) said, ""May Allah have mercy upon him. Indeed he knows that it is during the month of Ramadan and that it is the twenty-seventh night."" Then he swore by Allah. Zirr then said, ""How do you know that"" Ubayy replied, ""By a sign or an indication that he (the Prophet ) informed us of. It rises that next day having no rays on it -- meaning the sun."" Muslim has also recorded it. It has been said that it is the night of the twenty-ninth. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the Night of Decree and he replied,</p><p>«فِي رَمَضَانَ فَالْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ، فَإِنَّهَا فِي وِتْرٍ إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ ثَلَاثٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ خَمْسٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ سَبْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ تِسْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ فِي آخِرِ لَيْلَة»</p><p>(Seek it in Ramadan in the last ten nights. For verily, it is during the odd nights, the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-fifth, or the twenty-seventh, or the twenty-ninth, or during the last night.) Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said about the Night of Al-Qadr,</p><p>«إِنَّهَا لَيْلَةُ سَابِعَةٍ أَوْ تَاسِعَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، وَإِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تِلْكَ اللَّيْلَةَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ عَدَدِ الْحَصَى»</p><p>(Verily, it is during the twenty-seventh or the twenty-ninth night. And verily, the angels who are on the earth during that night are more numerous than the number of pebbles.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith and there is nothing wrong with its chain of narration. At-Tirmidhi recorded from Abu Qilabah that he said, ""The Night of Al-Qadr moves around (i.e., from year to year) throughout the last ten nights."" This view that At-Tirmidhi mentions from Abu Qilabah has also been recorded by Malik, Ath-Thawri, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahuyah, Abu Thawr, Al-Muzani, Abu Bakr bin Khuzaymah and others. It has also been related from Ash-Shafi`i, and Al-Qadi reported it from him, and this is most likely. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Supplication during the Night of Decree</h2><p>It is recommended to supplicate often during all times, especially during the month of Ramadan, in the last ten nights, and during the odd nights of it even more so. It is recommended that one say the following supplication a lot: ""O Allah! Verily, You are the Of the Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me."" This is due to what Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah, that she said, ""O Messenger of Allah! If I find the Night of Al-Qadr what should I say"" He replied,</p><p>«قُولِي: اللْهُمَّ إِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّي»</p><p>(Say: ""O Allah! Verily, You are the Of the Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me."") At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah have all recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, ""This Hadith is Hasan Sahih."" Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak (with a different chain of narration) and he said that it is authentic according to the criteria of the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). An-Nasa'i also recorded it. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Laylat Al-Qadr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>"

This is like what has been reported in a Hadith that has many routes of transmission,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«إِنَّ الْيَهُودَ اخْتَلَفُوا عَلَى إِحْدَى وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَإِنَّ النَّصَارَى اخْتَلَفُوا عَلى ثِنْتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَسَتَفْتَرِقُ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةُ عَلَى ثَلَاثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، كُلُّهَا فِي النَّارِ إِلَّا وَاحِدَة»</div><p>(Verily, the Jews differed until they became seventy-one sects.

He says that they will be in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement and they will abide therein forever. This means that they will remain in it and they will have no way out of it and they will not cease being in it.</p><p>أَوْلَـئِكَ هُمْ شَرُّ الْبَرِيَّةِ</p><p>(They are the worst of creatures.) meaning, they are the worst creation that Allah has fashioned and created. Then Allah informs about the situation of the righteous people who believed in their hearts and performed righteous deeds with their bodies. He says that they are the best of creation. Abu Hurayrah and a group of the scholars have used this Ayah as a proof that the believers have a status among the creatures that is better than the angels. This is because Allah says,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ</p><p>(They are the best of creatures.) Then Allah says,</p><p>جَزَآؤُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(Their reward with their Lord) meaning, on the Day of Judgement.</p><p>جَنَّـتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِى مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً</p><p>(is Eternal Gardens underneath which rivers flow.

The condition of Him being pleased with them is more illustri- ous than all of the everlasting delights that they will be given.</p><p>وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ</p><p>(and they well-pleased with Him.) Due to the comprehensive favors He has given them. Then Allah says,</p><p>ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ رَبَّهُ</p><p>(That is for him who fears his Lord.) meaning, this is the reward that will be attained by those who revere Allah and fear Him as He deserves to be feared. This is the person who worships Allah as if he sees Him, and he knows that even though he does not see Him, indeed Allah sees him. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَلَا أُخْبِرُكُمْ بِخَيْرِ الْبَرِيَّةِ؟»</p><p>(Shall I not inform you of the best of creation) They said, ""Of course, O Messenger of Allah!""

Gold and silver will come out like columns. A murderer will come and say, `I killed for this' The one who broke the ties of kinship will say, `For this I severed the ties of kinship' The thief will say, `For this I got my hands amputated' Then they will leave it there and no one will take anything from it.)"" Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَقَالَ الإِنسَـنُ مَا لَهَا </div><p>(And man will say: ""What is the matter with it"") meaning, he will be baffled by its situation after it used to be stable, settled and firm, and he used to be settled upon its surface. This refers to the alteration of the state of things and the earth moving and shaking. There will come to it inescapable quaking that Allah prepared for it. Then it will throw out its dead people -- from the first to the last generations. At that time the people will be baffled by the events and the earth changing into other than the earth, and the heavens as well. Then they will be presented before Allah, the One, the Irresistible. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا </div><p>(That Day it will declare its information.) meaning, it will speak of what the people did upon its surface. Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i all recorded a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah -- and in the wording of An-Nasa'i's version it states -- that he said, ""The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا </div><p>(That Day it will declare its information.) Then he said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«أَتَدْرُونَ مَا أَخْبَارُهَا؟»</div><p>(Do you know what is its information) They said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«فَإِنَّ أَخْبَارَهَا أَنْ تَشْهَدَ عَلَى كُلِّ عَبْدٍ وَأَمَةٍ بِمَا عَمِلَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا أَنْ تَقُولَ: عَمِلَ كَذَا وَكَذَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَهَذِهِ أَخْبَارُهَا»</div><p>(Verily, its information is that it will testify against every male and female servant, about what they did upon its surface. It will say that he did such and such on such and such day. So this is its information.)"" Then At-Tirmidhi said, ""This Hadith is Sahih Gharib."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَى لَهَا </div><p>(Because your Lord will inspire it.) It is apparent that the implied meaning here is that He will permit it (the earth). Shabib bin Bishr narrated from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا </div><p>(That Day it will declare its information.) ""Its Lord will say to it, `Speak.' So it will speak."" Mujahid commented (on ""inspire it""), "" He commands it (i.e., to speak). "" Al-Qurazi said, ""He will command it to separate from them."" Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتاً</div><p>(That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups (Ashtat)) meaning, they will return from the station of the Judgement in separate groups. This means that they will be divided into types and categories: between those who are miserable and those who are happy, and those who are commanded to go to Paradise and those who are commanded to go to the Hellfire. As-Suddi said, ""Ashtat means sects."" Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لِّيُرَوْاْ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ</div><p>(that they may be shown their deeds.) meaning, so that they may act and be rewarded for what they did in this life of good and evil.</p><h2>The Recompense for Every Minute Deed Therefore</h2><p>Allah goes on to say,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ </div><p>(So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of speck of dust shall see it.) Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«الْخَيْلُ لِثَلَاثَةٍ، لِرَجُلٍ أَجْرٌ، وَلِرَجُلٍ سِتْرٌ، وَعَلَى رَجُل وِزْرٌ. فَأَمَّا الَّذِي لَهُ أَجْرٌ فَرَجُلٌ رَبَطَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ فَأَطَالَ طِيَلَهَا فِي مَرْجٍ أَوْ رَوْضَةٍ، فَمَا أَصَابَتْ فِي طِيَلِهَا ذَلِكَ فِي الْمَرْج وَالرَّوْضَةِ كَانَ لَهُ حَسَنَاتٍ، وَلَوْ أَنَّهَا قَطَعَتْ طِيَلَهَا فَاسْتَنَّتْ شَرَفًا أَوْ شَرَفَيْنِ كَانَتْ آثَارُهَا وَأَرْوَاثُهَا حَسَنَاتٍ لَهُ، وَلَوْ أَنَّهَا مَرَّتْ بِنَهَرٍ فَشَرِبَتْ مِنْه وَلَمْ يُرِدْ أَنْ يَسْقِيَ بِهِ كَانَ ذَلِكَ حَسَنَاتٍ لَهُ، وَهِيَ لِذَلِكَ الرَّجُلِ أَجْرٌ. وَرَجُلٌ رَبَطَهَا تَغَنِّـيًا وَتَعَفُّفًا وَلَمْ يَنْسَ حَقَّ اللهِ فِي رِقَابِهَا وَلَا ظُهُورِهَا فَهِيَ لَهُ سِتْرٌ، وَرَجُلٌ رَبَطَها فَخْرًا وَرِيَاءً وَنِوَاءً فَهِيَ عَلَى ذَلِكَ وِزْر»</div><p>(The horses are for three. For one man they are a reward, for another man they are a shield, and for another man they are a burden. In reference to the man for whom they are a reward, he is the man who keeps them to be used in the way of Allah. Thus, they spend their entire life grazing in the pasture or garden (waiting in preparation for Jihad). So whatever afflicts them during that lengthy period in the pasture or garden, it will be counted as good deeds for him. Then, if their lengthy period is ended and they are used for a noble battle or two, their hoof prints and their dung are counted as good deeds for him.</p><p>When they passed through a stream from which they did drink, though he (their owner) does not intend to quench their thirst, yet, it would be counted as good deeds, Therefore, they are a reward for that man. A man who keeps them to maintain himself and to be independent of others (i.e., begging, etc.), and he does not forget the right of Allah upon their necks and their backs (i.e., their Zakah), then they are a shield for him (from the Hellfire). A man who keeps them in order to boast, brag and show off, then they are a burden for him (on Judgement Day).) So the Messenger of Allah was then asked about the donkeys and he said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ فِيهَا شَيْئًا إِلَّا هَذِهِ الْايَةَ الْفَاذَّةَ الْجَامِعَةَ</div><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ </div><div class=""arabic uthmani"">»</div><p>(Allah has not revealed anything concerning them except this single, comprehensive Ayah: (So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of speck of dust shall see it.)) Muslim also recorded this Hadith. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded from `Adi that the Prophet said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«اتَّــقُوا النَّارَ وَلَوْ بِشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ، وَلَوْ بِكَلِمَةٍ طَيِّـبَة»</div><p>(Fear (ward off) the Fire, even if by giving half a date in charity, and even by saying a single word of good.) In the Sahih as well, he (`Adi) narrated (from the Prophet ):</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«لَا تَحْقِرَنَّ مِنَ الْمَعْرُوفِ شَيْئًا وَلَوْ أَنْ تُفْرِغَ مِنْ دَلْوِكَ فِي إِنَاءِ الْمُسْتَسْقِي، وَلَوْ أَنْ تَلْقَى أَخَاكَ وَوَجْهُكَ إِلَيْهِ مُنْـبَسِط»</div><p>(Do not under rate any good act, even if it is offering drinking water from your bucket to one who is seeking a drink, or meeting your brother with a cheerful face.) It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«يَا مَعْشَرَ نِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ، لَا تَحْقِرَنَّ جَارَةٌ لِجَارَتِهَا وَلَوْ فِرْسَنَ شَاة»</div><p>(O party of believing women! None of you should belittle a gift sent by your neighbor, even if it is a Firsan of a sheep.) The word Firsan in this Hadith means its hoof. In another Hadith he said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«رُدُّوا السَّائِلَ وَلَوْ بِظِلْفٍ مُحْرَق»</div><p>(Give something to the beggar, even if it is a burnt hoof.) It has been reported from `A'ishah that she gave a single grape in charity and then she said, ""To how much dust is it equivelent"" Imam Ahmad recorded from `Awf bin Al-Harith bin At-Tufayl that `A'ishah told him that the Prophet used to say,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«يَاعَائِشَةُ، إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»</div><p>(O `A'ishah! Beware of the sins that are belittled, for indeed they will be taken account of by Allah.) This Hadith was recorded by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">«إِيَّاكُمْ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّهُنَّ يَجْتَمِعْنَ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ حَتْى يُهْلِكْنَه»</div><p>(Beware of the sins that are belittled. For verily, they are gathered in a man until they destroy him.) And indeed the Messenger of Allah made an example of them (sins that are taken lightly) by saying that they are like a people who settle in barren land. Then their leader comes and orders the men to go out one at a time and each bring back a stick until they have gathered a large number of sticks. Then they kindled a fire and burned everything that they threw into it.This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Idha Zulzilat (Az-Zalzalah) and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"

This is just as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to perform raids in the early morning. He would wait to see if he heard the Adhan (call to prayer) from the people. If he heard it he would leave them alone, and if he didn't hear it he would attack. Then Allah says,</p><p>فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعاً</p><p>(And raise the dust in clouds the while.) meaning, dust at the place of the battle with the horses.</p><p>فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعاً</p><p>(And penetrating forthwith as one into the midst.) means, then are all in the middle of that spot, together. Allah's saying;</p><p>فَالْمُغِيرَتِ صُبْحاً</p><p>(And scouring to the raid at dawn.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, ""This means the invasion of the horses in the morning in the way of Allah."" And His statement,</p><p>فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعاً</p><p>(And raise the dust in clouds the while.) This is the place in which the attack takes place. The dust is stirred up by it. And His statement,</p><p>فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعاً</p><p>(And penetrating forthwith as one into the midst.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas, `Ata, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak that they all said, ""This means into the midst of the disbelieving enemy."" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لِرَبِّهِ لَكَنُودٌ</p><p>(Verily, man is ungrateful (Kanud) to his Lord.) This is the subject what is being sworn about, and it means that he (man) is ungrateful for the favors of His Lord and he rejects them. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Abu Al-Jawza', Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Ad-Duha, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Qays, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Zayd all said, ""Al-Kanud means ungrateful.""

Qatadah and Sufyan Ath-Thawri both said, ""And indeed Allah is a witness to that."" It is also possible that the pronoun (He) could be referring to man. This was said by Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. Thus, its meaning would be that man is a witness himself to the fact that he is ungrateful. This is obvious in his condition, meaning this is apparent from his statements and deeds. This is as Allah says,</p><p>مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُواْ مَسَاجِدَ الله شَـهِدِينَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِم بِالْكُفْرِ</p><p>(It is not for the idolators, to maintain the Masajid of Allah, while they witness disbelief against themselves.) (9:17) Allah said;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ</p><p>(And verily, he is violent in the love of wealth.) meaning, and indeed in his love of the good, which is wealth, he is severe. There are two opinions concerning this. One of them is that it means that he is severe. There are two opinions concerning this. One of them is that it means that he is severe in his love of wealth. The other view is that it means he is covetous and stingy due to the love of wealth. However, both views are correct.</p><h2>The Threat about the Hereafter</h2><p>Then Allah encourages abstinence from worldly things and striving for the Hereafter, and He informs of what the situation will be after this present condition, and what man will face of horrors. He says,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَعْلَمُ إِذَا بُعْثِرَ مَا فِى الْقُبُورِ</p><p>(Knows he not that when the contents of the graves are poured forth) meaning, the dead that are in it will be brought out.</p><p>وَحُصِّلَ مَا فِى الصُّدُورِ</p><p>(And that which is in the breasts shall be made known) Ibn `Abbas and others have said, ""This means what was in their souls would be exposed and made apparent.""</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّهُم بِهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّخَبِيرٌ</p><p>(Verily, that Day their Lord will be Well-Acquainted with them.) meaning, He knows all of that they used to do, and He will compensate them for it with the most deserving reward. He does not do even the slightest amount of injustice. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-`Adiyat, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"

This is like Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ</p><p>(As if they were locusts spread abroad.)

He says,</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَزِينُهُ</p><p>(Then as for him whose Balance will be heavy.) meaning, his good deeds are more than his bad deeds.</p><p>فَهُوَ فِى عِيشَةٍ رَّاضِيَةٍ</p><p>(He will live a pleasant life.) meaning, in Paradise.</p><p>وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَزِينُهُ</p><p>(But as for him whose Balance will be light.) meaning, his bad deeds are more than his good deeds. Then Allah says,</p><p>فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ</p><p>(His mother will be Hawiyah.) It has been said that this means he will be falling and tumbling headfirst into the fire of Hell, and the expression `his mother' has been used to refer to his brain (as it is the mother of his head). A statement similar to this has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih and Qatadah. Qatadah said, ""He will fall into the Hellfire on his head."" Abu Salih made a similar statement when he said, ""They will fall into the Fire on their heads."" It has also been said that it means his mother that he will return to and end up with in the Hereafter will be Hawiyah, which is one of the names of the Hellfire. Ibn Jarir said, ""Al-Hawiyah is only called his mother because he will have no other abode except for it."" Ibn Zayd said, ""Al-Hawiyah is the Fire, and it will be his mother and his abode to which he will return, and where he will be settled."" Then he recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَأْوَاهُمُ النَّارُ</p><p>(Their abode will be the Fire.) (3:151) Ibn Abi Hatim said that it has been narrated from Qatadah that he said, ""It is the Fire, and it is their abode."" Thus, Allah says in explaining the meaning of Al-Hawiyah,</p><p>وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا هِيَهْ</p><p>(And what will make you know what it is). Allah's statement</p><p>نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ</p><p>(A fire Hamiyah!) meaning, extreme heat. It is a heat that is accompanied by a strong flame and fire.

But do you get anything (of benefit) from your wealth except for that which you ate and you finished it, or that which you clothed yourself with and you wore it out, or that which you gave as charity and you have spent it)"" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ الْعَبْدُ: مَالِي مَالِي، وَإِنَّمَا لَهُ مِنْ مَالِهِ ثَلَاثٌ: مَا أَكَلَ فَأَفْنَى، أَوْ لَبِسَ فَأَبْلَى، أَوْ تَصَدَّقَ فَأَمْضَى، وَمَا سِوَى ذَلِكَ فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»</p><p>(The servant says ""My wealth, my wealth."" Yet he only gets three (benefits) from his wealth: that which he eats and finishes, that which he eats and finishes, that which he wears until it is worn out, or that which he gives in charity and it is spent. Everything else other than that will go away and leave him for the people.) Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَتْبَعُ الْمَيِّتَ ثَلَاثَةٌ، فَيَرْجِعُ اثْنَانِ وَيَبْقَى مَعَهُ وَاحِدٌ: يَتْبَعُهُ أَهْلُهُ وَمَالُهُ وَعَمَلُهُ، فَيَرْجِعُ أَهْلُهُ وَمَالُهُ، وَيَبْقَى عَمَلُه»</p><p>(Three things follow the deceased person, and two of them return while one remains behind with him. The things which follow him are his family, his wealth and his deeds. His family and his wealth return while his deeds remain.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas that the Prophet said,</p><p>«يَهْرَمُ ابْنُ آدَمَ وَيَبْقَى مِنْهُ اثْنَتَانِ: الْحِرْصُ وَالْأَمَل»</p><p>(The Son of Adam becomes old with senility, but yet two things remain with him: greed and hope.) Both of them (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith in the Two Sahihs.</p>"

6177,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>How `Amr bin Al-`As was aware of the Qur'an's Miracle due to this Surah</h2><p>They have mentioned that `Amr bin Al-`As went to visit Musaylimah Al-Kadhdhab after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was commissioned (as a Prophet) and before `Amr had accepted Islam. Upon his arrival, Musaylimah said to him, ""What has been revealed to your friend (Muhammad ﷺ ) during this time"" `Amr said, ""A short and concise Surah has been revealed to him."" Musaylimah then said, ""What is it"" `Amr replied;</p><p>وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ - إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالصَّبْرِ</p><p>(By Al-`Asr. Verily, man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience.) So Musaylimah thought for a while. Then he said, ""Indeed something similar has also been revealed to me."" `Amr asked him, ""What is it"" He replied, ""O Wabr (a small, furry mammal; hyrax), O Wabr! You are only two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is digging and burrowing."" Then he said, ""What do you think, O `Amr"" So `Amr said to him, ""By Allah! Verily, you know that I know you are lying."" I saw that Abu Bakr Al-Khara'iti mentioned a chain of narration for part of this story, or what was close to its meaning, in volume two of his famous book Masawi' ul-Akhlaq. The Wabr is a small animal that resembles a cat, and the largest thing on it is its ears and its torso, while the rest of it is ugly. Musayli- mah intended by the composition of these nonsensical verses to produce something which would oppose the Qur'an. Yet, it was not even convin- cing to the idol wor- shipper of that time. At-Tabarani recorded from `Abdullah bin Hisn Abi Madinah that he said, ""Whenever two men from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to meet, they would not part until one of them had recited Surat Al-`Asr in its entirety to the other, and one of them had given the greetings of peace to the other."" Ash-Shafi`i said, ""If the people were to ponder on this Surah, it would be sufficient for them.""</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Al-`Asr is the time in which the movements of the Children of Adam occur, whether good or evil.</h2><p>Malik narrated from Zayd bin Aslam that he said, ""It is the evening."" However, the first view is the popular opinion. Thus, Allah swears by this, that man is in Khusr, which means in loss and destruction.</p><p>إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds) So Allah makes an exception, among the species of man being in loss, for those who believe in their hearts and work righteous deeds with their limbs.</p><p>وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(And recommend one another to the truth,) This is to perform acts of obedience and avoid the forbidden things.</p><p>وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالصَّبْرِ</p><p>(And recommend one another to patience.) meaning, with the plots, the evils, and the harms of those who harm people due to their commanding them to do good and forbidding them from evil.

They did this even though this Surah is directly related to the one which precedes it, as Muhammad bin Ishaq and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam have both clarified. This is because the meaning of both of them is, ""We have prevented the Elephant from entering Makkah and We have destroyed its people in order to gather (Ilaf) the Quraysh, which means to unite them and bring them together safely in their city."" It has also been said that the meaning of this (Ilaf) is what they would gather during their journey in the winter to Yemen and in the summer to Ash-Sham through trade and other than that. Then they would return to their city in safety during their journeys due to the respect that the people had for them because they were the residents of Allah's sanctuary. Therefore, whoever knew them would honor them. Even those who came to them and traveled with them, would be safe because of them. This was their situation during their journeys and travels during their winter and summer. In reference to their living in the city, then it is as Allah said,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً ءامِناً وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ</div><p>(Have they not seen that We have made it a secure sanctuary, while men are being snatched away from all around them) (29:67) Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">لإِيلَـفِ قُرَيْشٍ إِيلَـفِهِمْ</div><p>(For the Ilaf of the Quraysh. Their Ilaf) This is a subject that has been transferred from the first sentence in order to give it more explanation. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِيلَـفِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَآءِ وَالصَّيْفِ </div><p>(Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) Ibn Jarir said, ""The correct opinion is that the letter Lam is a prefix that shows amazement. It is as though He (Allah) is saying, `You should be amazed at the uniting (or taming) of the Quraysh and My favor upon them in that.""' He went on to say, ""This is due to the consensus of the Muslims that they are two separate and independent Surahs."" Then Allah directs them to be grateful for this magnificent favor in His saying,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">فَلْيَعْبُدُواْ رَبَّ هَـذَا الْبَيْتِ </div><p>(So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) meaning, then let them single Him out for worship, just as He has given them a safe sanctuary and a Sacred House. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ رَبِّ هَذِهِ الْبَلْدَةِ الَّذِى حَرَّمَهَا وَلَهُ كُلُّ شَىءٍ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>(I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this city, Who has sanctified it and to Whom belongs everything.

(27:91) Then Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">الَّذِى أَطْعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٍ</div><p>(Who has fed them against hunger,) meaning, He is the Lord of the House and He is the One Who feeds them against hunger.</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَءَامَنَهُم مِّنْ خوْفٍ</div><p>(And has made them safe from fear.) meaning, He favors them with safety and gentleness, so they should single Him out for worship alone, without any partner. They should not worship any idol, rival or statue besides Him. Therefore, whoever accepts this command, Allah will give him safety in both this life and the Hereafter. However, whoever disobeys Him, He will remove both of them from him. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=""arabic uthmani"">وَضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلاً قَرْيَةً كَانَتْ ءَامِنَةً مُّطْمَئِنَّةً يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَدًا مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ فَكَفَرَتْ بِأَنْعُمِ اللَّهِ فَأَذَاقَهَا اللَّهُ لِبَاسَ الْجُوعِ وَالْخَوْفِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْنَعُونَ - وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَهُمْ ظَـلِمُونَ </div><p>(And Allah puts forward the example of a township, that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it denied the favors of Allah.

He does not feed him, nor is he kind to him.</p><p>وَلاَ يَحُضُّ عَلَى طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ</p><p>(And urges not the feeding of Al-Miskin.)

And urge not one another on the feeding of Al-Miskin!) (89:17-18) meaning, the poor man who has nothing to sustain him and suffice his needs. Then Allah says,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَـتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ</p><p>(So, woe unto those performers of Salah, those who with their Salah are Sahun.) Ibn `Abbas and others have said, ""This means the hypocrites who pray in public but do not pray in private."" Thus, Allah says,</p><p>لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ</p><p>(unto those performers of Salah,) They are those people who pray and adhere to the prayer, yet they are mindless of it. This may either be referring to its act entirely, as Ibn `Abbas said, or it may be referring to performing it in its stipulated time that has been legislated Islamically. This means that the person prays it completely outside of its time.</p><h2>This was said by Masruq and Abu Ad-Duha.</h2><p>`Ata' bin Dinar said, ""All praise is due to Allah, the One Who said,</p><p>عَن صَلَـتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ</p><p>(with their Salah are Sahun.) and He did not say, `those who are absent minded in their prayer.""' It could also mean the first time of the prayer, which means they always delay it until the end of its time, or they usually do so. It may also refer to not fulfilling its pillars and conditions, and in the required manner. It could also mean performing it with humility and contemplation of its meanings. The wording of the Ayah comprises all of these meanings. However, whoever has any characteristic of this that we have mentioned then a portion of this Ayah applies to him. And whoever has all of these characteristics, then he has completed his share of this Ayah, and the hypocrisy of actions is fulfilled in him. This is just as is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«تِلْكَ صَلَاةُ الْمُنَافِقِ، تِلْكَ صَلَاةُ الْمُنَافِقِ، تِلْكَ صَلَاةُ الْمُنَافِقِ، يَجْلِسُ يَرْقُبُ الشَّمْسَ، حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَتْ بَيْنَ قَرْنَي الشَّيْطَانِ قَامَ فَنَقَرَ أَرْبَعًا، لَا يَذْكُرُ اللهَ فِيهَا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا»</p><p>(This is the prayer of the hypocrite, this is the prayer of the hypocrite, this is the prayer of the hypocrite. He sits watching the sun until it is between the two horns of Shaytan. Then he stands and pecks four (Rak`ahs) and he does not remember Allah (in them) except very little.) This Hadith is describing the end of the time for the `Asr prayer, which is the middle prayer as is confirmed by a text (Hadith). This is the time in which it is disliked to pray. Then this person stands to pray it, pecking in it like the pecking of a crow. He does not have tranquility or humility in it at all. Thus, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا يَذْكُرُ اللهَ فِيهَا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا»</p><p>(He does not remember Allah (in them) except very little.) He probably only stands to pray it so that the people will see him praying, and not seeking the Face of Allah. This is just as if he did not pray at all. Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ يُخَـدِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُواْ إِلَى الصَّلَوةِ قَامُواْ كُسَالَى يُرَآءُونَ النَّاسَ وَلاَ يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً</p><p>(Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little.) (4:142) and Allah says here,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَآءُونَ</p><p>(Those who do good deeds only to be seen,) Imam Ahmad recorded from `Amr bin Murrah that he said, ""We were sitting with Abu `Ubaydah when the people mentioned showing-off. A man known as Abu Yazid said, ""I heard `Abdullah bin `Amr saying that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ سَمَّعَ النَّاسَ بِعَمَلِهِ، سَمَّعَ اللهُ بِهِ سَامِعَ خَلْقِهِ، وَحَقَّرَهُ وَصَغَّرَه»</p><p>(Whoever tries to make the people hear of his deed, Allah, the One Who hears His creation, will hear it and make him despised and degraded.)"" from what is related to his statement,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَآءُونَ</p><p>(Those who do good deeds only to be seen.) is that whoever does a deed solely for Allah, but the people come to know about it, and he is pleased with that, then this is not considered showing off. Allah said:</p><p>وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ</p><p>(And withhold Al-Ma`un.) This means that they do not worship their Lord well, nor do they treat His creation well. They do not even lend that which others may benefit from and be helped by, even though the object will remain intact and be returned to them. These people are even stingier when it comes to giving Zakah and different types of charity that bring one closer to Allah. Al-Mas`udi narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydin that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about Al-Ma`un and he said, ""It is what the people give to each other, like an axe, a pot, a bucket and similar items.""

Al-Bukhari recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that Ibn `Abbas said about Al-Kawthar, ""It is the good which Allah gave to him (the Prophet)."" Abu Bishr said, ""I said to Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Verily, people are claiming that it is a river in Paradise.""' Sa`id replied, `The river which is in Paradise is part of the goodness which Allah gave him.""' Al-Bukhari also recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Al-Kawthar is the abundant goodness."" This explanation includes the river and other things as well. Because the word Al-Kawthar comes from the word Kathrah (abundance) and it (Al-Kawthar) linguistically means an abundance of goodness. So from this goodness is the river (in Paradise). Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْكَوْثَرُ نَهْرٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ حَافَتَاهُ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ، وَالْمَاءُ يَجْرِي عَلَى اللُّؤْلُؤِ، وَمَاؤُهُ أَشَدُّ بَيَاضًا مِنَ اللَّبَنِ، وَأَحْلَى مِنَ الْعَسَل»</p><p>(Al-Kawthar is a river in Paradise whose banks are of gold and it runs over pearls. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey.) This Hadith was recorded in this manner by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih."" Then Allah says,</p><p>فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ</p><p>(Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice.) meaning, `just as We have given you the abundant goodness in this life and the Hereafter -- and from that is the river that has been described previously -- then make your obligatory and optional prayer, and your sacrifice (of animals) solely and sincerely for your Lord. Woship Him alone and do not associate any partner with him. And sacrifice pronouncing His Name alone, without ascribing any partner to Him.' This is as Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِى وَنُسُكِى وَمَحْيَاىَ وَمَمَاتِى للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>(Say: ""Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims."") (6:162-163) Ibn `Abbas, `Ata,' Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan all said, ""This means with this the Budn should be sacrificed."" Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi`, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Al-Hakam, Isma`il bin Abi Khalid and others from the Salaf have all said the same. This is the opposite of the way of the idolators, prostrating to other than Allah and sacrificing in other than His Name. Allah says,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ</p><p>(And do not eat from what Allah's Name has not been pronounced over, indeed that is Fisq.) (6:121)</p><h2>The Enemy of the Prophet is Cut Off</h2><p>Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الاٌّبْتَرُ</p><p>(For he who hates you, he will be cut off.) meaning, `indeed he who hates you, O Muhammad, and he hates what you have come with of guidance, truth, clear proof and manifest light, he is the most cut off, meanest, lowliest person who will not be remembered. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Qatadah all said, ""This Ayah was revealed about Al-`As bin Wa'il. Whenever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would be mentioned (in his presence) he would say, `Leave him, for indeed he is a man who is cut off having no descendants. So when he dies he will not be remembered.' Therefore, Allah revealed this Surah."" Shamir bin `Atiyah said, ""This Surah was revealed concerning `Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ayt."" Ibn `Abbas and `Ikrimah have both said, ""This Surah was revealed about Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf and a group of the disbelievers of the Quraysh."" Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf came to Makkah and the Quraysh said to him, `You are the leader of them (the people). What do you think about this worthless man who is cut off from his people He claims that he is better than us while we are the people of the place of pilgrimage, the people of custodianship (of the Ka`bah), and the people who supply water to the pilgrims.' He replied, `You all are better than him.' So Allah revealed,</p><p>إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الاٌّبْتَرُ</p><p>(For he who hates you, he will be cut off.)"" This is how Al-Bazzar recorded this incident and its chain of narration is authentic. It has been reported that `Ata' said, ""This Surah was revealed about Abu Lahab when a son of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died. Abu Lahab went to the idolators and said, `Muhammad has been cut off (i.e., from progeny) tonight.' So concerning this Allah revealed,</p><p>إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الاٌّبْتَرُ</p><p>(For he who hates you, he will be cut off.)"" As-Suddi said, ""When the male sons of a man died the people used to say, `He has been cut off.' So, when the sons of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ </p><p>died they said, `Muhammad has been cut off.' Thus, Allah revealed,</p><p>إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الاٌّبْتَرُ</p><p>(For he who hates you, he will be cut off.)"" So they thought in their ignorance that if his sons died, his remembrance would be cut off. Allah forbid! To the contrary, Allah preserved his remembrance for all the world to see, and He obligated all the servants to follow his Law. This will continue for all of time until the Day of Gathering and the coming of the Hereafter. May the blessings of Allah and His peace be upon him forever until the Day of Assembling. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Kawthar, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>"

6208,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Recitation of these Surahs in the Optional Prayers</h2><p>It has been confirmed in Sahih Muslim from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Surah (Al-Kafirun) and</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>(Say: ""He is Allah One."") (112:1) in the two Rak`ahs of Tawaf. It is also recorded in Sahih Muslim in a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited these two Surahs in the two Rak`ahs (optional prayer) of the Morning prayer. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited in the two Rak`ahs before the Morning prayer and the two Rak`ahs after the Sunset prayer on approximately ten or twenty different occasions,</p><p>قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(Say: ""O Al-Kafirun!"") and</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>(Say: "" He is Allah One."")

(112:1)"" Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said, ""I watched the Prophet for a month and he would recite in the two Rak`ahs before the Morning prayer,</p><p>قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(Say: ""O Al-Kafirun."") and</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>(Say: ""He is Allah One."") (112:1)"" This was also recor- ded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan."" It has already been mentioned previously in a Hadith that it (Surat Al-Kafirun) is equivalent to a fourth of the Qur'an and Az-Zalzalah is equivalent to a fourth of the Qur'an.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Declaration of Innocence from Shirk</h2><p>This Surah is the Surah of disavowal from the deeds of the idolators. It commands a complete disavowal of that. Allah's statement,</p><p>قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(Say: ""O disbelievers!"") includes every disbeliever on the face of the earth, however, this statement is particularly directed towards the disbelievers of the Quraysh. It has been said that in their ignorance they invited the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to worship their idols for a year and they would (in turn) worship his God for a year. Therefore, Allah revealed this Surah and in it</p><h2>He commanded His Messenger to disavow himself from their religion completely</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لاَ أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ</p><p>(I worship not that which you worship.) meaning, statues and rival gods.</p><p>وَلاَ أَنتُمْ عَـبِدُونَ مَآ أَعْبُدُ</p><p>(Nor will you worship whom I worship.) and He is Allah Alone, Who has no partner. So the word Ma (what) here means Man (who). Then Allah says,</p><p>وَلاَ أَنَآ عَابِدٌ مَّا عَبَدتُّمْ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ عَـبِدُونَ مَآ أَعْبُدُ</p><p>(And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping. Nor will you worship whom I worship.) meaning, `I do not worship according to your worship, which means that I do not go along with it or follow it. I only worship Allah in the manner in which He loves and is pleased with.' Thus, Allah says,</p><p>وَلاَ أَنتُمْ عَـبِدُونَ مَآ أَعْبُدُ</p><p>(Nor will you worship whom I worship.) meaning, `you do not follow the commands of Allah and His Legislation in His worship. Rather, you have invented something out of the promptings of your own souls.' This is as Allah says,</p><p>إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الاٌّنفُسُ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire, whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord!) (53:23) Therefore, the disavowal is from all of what they are involved. For certainly the worshipper must have a god whom he worships and set acts of worship that he follows to get to him. So the Messenger and his followers worship Allah according to what He has legislated. This is why the statement of Islam is ""There is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah."" This means that there is no (true) object of worship except Allah and there is no path to Him (i.e., way of worshipping Him) other than that which the Messenger came with. The idolators worship other than Allah, with acts of worship that Allah has not allowed. This is why the Messenger said to them,</p><p>لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِىَ دِينِ</p><p>(To you be your religion, and to me my religion.) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّى عَمَلِى وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ أَنتُمْ بَرِيئُونَ مِمَّآ أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَاْ بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And if they belie you, say: ""For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do!"") (10:41) and He said,</p><p>لَنَآ أَعْمَـلُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَـلُكُمْ</p><p>(To us our deeds, and to you your deeds.) (28:55) Al-Bukhari said, ""It has been said,</p><p>لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</p><p>(To you be your religion.) means disbelief.</p><p>وَلِىَ دِينِ</p><p>(and to me my religion.) means, Islam.

An-Nasa'i recorded from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah that Ibn `Abbas said to him, ""O Ibn `Utbah! Do you know the last Surah of the Qur'an that was revealed"" He answered, ""Yes, it was</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p>(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.)

However, it was as if one of them felt something in himself (against my attending). So he said, `Why do you (`Umar) bring this (youth) to sit with us when we have children like him (i.e., his age)' So `Umar replied, `Verily, he is among those whom you know. Then one day he called them and invited me to sit with them, and I do not think that he invited me to be among them that day except to show them. So he said, `What do you say about Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p>(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.)' Some of them said, `We were commanded to praise Allah and seek His forgiveness when He helps us and gives us victory.' Some of them remained silent and did not say anything. Then he (`Umar) said to me, `Is this what you say, O Ibn `Abbas' I said, `No.' He then said, `What do you say' I said, `It was the end of the life of Allah's Messenger ﷺ that Allah was informing him of. Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p>(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.) which means, that is a sign of the end of your life.</p><p>فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَاسْتَغْفِرْهُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوِبَا</p><p>(So, glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.)' So, `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, `I do not know anything about it other than what you have said.""' Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, ""When</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p>(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نُعِيَتْ إِلَيَّ نَفْسِي»</p><p>(My death has been announced to me.) And indeed he died during that year."" Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say often in his bowing and prostrating,</p><p>«سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَا وَبِحَمْدِكَ اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي»</p><p>(Glory to You, O Allah, our Lord, and praise be to You. O Allah, forgive me.) He did this as his interpretation of the Qur'an (i.e., showing its implementation)."" The rest of the group has also recorded this Hadith except for At-Tirmidhi. Imam Ahmad recorded from Masruq that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to often say towards the end of his life,</p><p>«سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْه»</p><p>(Glory to Allah, and praise be unto Him. I seek Allah's forgiveness and I repent to Him.) And he said,</p><p>«إِنَّ رَبِّي كَانَ أَخْبَرَنِي أَنِّي سَأَرَى عَلَامَةً فِي أُمَّتِي، وَأَمَرَنِي إِذَا رَأَيْتُهَا أَنْ أُسَبِّحَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَأَسْتَغْفِرَهُ، إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوَّابًا، فَقَدْ رَأَيْتُهَا:</p><p>إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ - وَرَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِى دِينِ اللَّهِ أَفْوَجاً - فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَاسْتَغْفِرْهُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوِبَا »</p><p>(Verily, my Lord has informed me that I will see a sign in my Ummah and He has commanded me that when I see it, I should glorify His praises and seek His forgiveness, for He is the One Who accepts repentance. And indeed I have seen it (i.e., the sign). (When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest (Al-Fath). And you see that the people enter Allah's religion in crowds. So glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.))"" Muslim also recorded this Hadith. The meaning of Al-Fath here is the conquest of Makkah, and there is only one view concerning it. For indeed the different areas of the Arabs were waiting for the conquest of Makkah before they would accept Islam. They said, ""If he (Muhammad ﷺ is victorious over his people, then he is a (true) Prophet."" So when Allah gave him victory over Makkah, they entered into the religion of Allah (Islam) in crowds. Thus, two years did not pass (after the conquest of Makkah) before the peninsula of the Arabs was laden with faith. And there did not remain any of the tribes of the Arabs except that they professed (their acceptance) of Islam. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that `Amr bin Salamah said, ""When Makkah was conquered, all of the people rushed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to profess their Islam. The various regions were delaying their acceptance of Islam until Makkah was conquered. The people used to say, `Leave him and his people alone. If he is victorious over them he is a (true) Prophet.""' We have researched the war expedition for conquest of Makkah in our book As-Surah. Therefore, whoever wishes he may review it there. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah.Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu `Ammar that a neighbor of Jabir bin `Abdullah told him, ""I returned from a journey and Jabir bin `Abdullah came and greeted me. So I began to talk with him about the divisions among the people and what they had started doing. Thus, Jabir began to cry and he said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«إِنَّ النَّاسَ دَخَلُوا فِي دِينِ اللهِ أَفْوَاجًا، وَسَيَخْرُجُونَ مِنْهُ أَفْوَاجًا»</p><p>(Verily, the people have entered into the religion of Allah in crowds and they will also leave it in crowds.)""

Then he cried out,</p><p>«يَا صَبَاحَاه»</p><p>(O people, come at once!) So the Quraysh gathered around him. Then he said,</p><p>«أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكُمْ أَنَّ الْعَدُوَّ مُصَبِّحُكُمْ، أَوْ مُمَسِّيكُمْ أَكُنْتُمْ تُصَدِّقُونِّي»</p><p>؟ (If I told you all that the enemy was going to attack you in the morning, or in the evening, would you all believe me) They replied, ""Yes."" Then he said,</p><p>«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»</p><p>(Verily, I am a warner (sent) to you all before the coming of a severe torment.) Then Abu Lahab said, ""Have you gathered us for this May you perish!"" Thus, Allah revealed,</p><p>تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ</p><p>(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) to the end of the Surah. In another narration it states that he stood up dusting of his hands and said, ""Perish you for the rest of this day! Have you gathered us for this"" Then Allah revealed,</p><p>تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ</p><p>(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) The first part is a supplication against him and the second is information about him. This man Abu Lahab was one of the uncles of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.His name was `Abdul-`Uzza bin Abdul-Muttalib. His surname was Abu `Utaybah and he was only called Abu Lahab because of the brightness of his face. He used to often cause harm to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He hated and scorned him and his religion. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Az-Zinad that a man called Rabi`ah bin `Abbad from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dil, who was a man of pre-Islamic ignorance who accepted Islam, said to him, ""I saw the Prophet in the time of pre-Islamic ignorance in the market of Dhul-Majaz and he was saying,</p><p>«يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، قُولُوا: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ تُفْلِحُوا»</p><p>(O people! Say there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and you will be successful.) The people were gathered around him and behind him there was a man with a bright face, squint (or cross) eyes and two braids in his hair. He was saying, ""Verily, he is an apostate (from our religion) and a liar!"" This man was following him (the Prophet ) around wherever he went. So, I asked who was he and they (the people) said, ""This is his uncle, Abu Lahab."" Ahmad also recorded this narration from Surayj, who reported it from Ibn Abu Az-Zinad, who reported it from his father (Abu Zinad) who mentioned this same narration. However in this report, Abu Zinad said, ""I said to Rabi`ah, `Were you a child at that time' He replied, `No. By Allah, that day I was most intelligent, and I was the strongest blower of the flute (for music).""' Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ</p><p>(His wealth and his children (Kasab) will not benefit him!) Ibn `Abbas and others have said,</p><p>وَمَا كَسَبَ</p><p>(and his children (Kasab) will not benefit him!) ""Kasab means his children."" A similar statement has been reported from `A'ishah, Mujahid, `Ata', Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin. It has been mentioned from Ibn Mas`ud that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called his people to faith, Abu Lahab said, ""Even if what my nephew says is true, I will ransom myself (i.e., save myself) from the painful torment on the Day of Judgement with my wealth and my children."" Thus, Allah revealed,</p><p>مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ</p><p>(His wealth and his children will not benefit him!) Then Allah says,</p><p>سَيَصْلَى نَاراً ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ</p><p>(He will enter a Fire full of flames!) meaning, it has flames, evil and severe burning.</p><h2>The Destiny of Umm Jamil, the Wife of Abu Lahab</h2><p>وَامْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ</p><p>(And his wife too, who carries wood.) His wife was among the leading women of the Quraysh and she was known as Umm Jamil. Her name was `Arwah bint Harb bin Umayyah and she was the sister of Abu Sufyan. She was supportive of her husband in his disbelief, rejection and obstinacy. Therefore, she will be helping to administer his punishment in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement. Thus, Allah says,</p><p>وَامْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ - فِى جِيدِهَا حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ</p><p>(Who carries wood. In her neck is a twisted rope of Masad.) meaning, she will carry the firewood and throw it upon her husband to increase that which he is in (of torment), and she will be ready and prepared to do so.</p><p>فِى جِيدِهَا حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ</p><p>(In her neck is a twisted rope of Masad.) Mujahid and `Urwah both said, ""From the palm fiber of the Fire."" Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas, `Atiyah Al-Jadali, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd that she used to place thorns in the path of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Al-Jawhari said, ""Al-Masad refers to fibers, it is also a rope made from fibers or palm leaves. It is also made from the skins of camels or their furs. It is said (in Arabic) Masadtul-Habla and Amsaduhu Masadan, when you tightly fasten its twine."" Mujahid said,</p><p>فِى جِيدِهَا حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ</p><p>(In her neck is a twisted rope of Masad.) ""This means a collar of iron."" Don't you see that the Arabs call a pulley cable a Masad</p><h2>A Story of Abu Lahab's Wife harming the Messenger of Allah ﷺ</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim said that his father and Abu Zur`ah both said that `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr Al-Humaydi told them that Sufyan informed them that Al-Walid bin Kathir related from Ibn Tadrus who reported that Asma' bint Abi Bakr said, ""When</p><p>تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ</p><p>(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he)!) was revealed, the one-eyed Umm Jamil bint Harb came out wailing, and she had a stone in her hand. She was saying, `He criticizes our father, and his religion is our scorn, and his command is to disobey us.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting in the Masjid (of the Ka`bah) and Abu Bakr was with him. When Abu Bakr saw her he said, `O Messenger of Allah! She is coming and I fear that she will see you.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ replied,</p><p>«إِنَّهَا لَنْ تَرَانِي»</p><p>(Verily, she will not see me.) Then he recited some of the Qur'an as a protection for himself. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرءَانَ جَعَلْنَا بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ حِجَابًا مَّسْتُورًا</p><p>(And when you recite the Qur'an, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an invisible veil.) (17:45) So she advanced until she was standing in front of Abu Bakr and she did not see the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . She then said, `O Abu Bakr! Verily, I have been informed that your friend is making defamatory poetry about me.' Abu Bakr replied, `Nay! By the Lord of this House (the Ka`bah) he is not defaming you.' So she turned away saying, `Indeed the Quraysh know that I am the daughter of their leader.""' Al-Walid or another person said in a different version of this Hadith, ""So Umm Jamil stumbled over her waist gown while she was making circuits (Tawaf) around the House (the Ka`bah) and she said, `Cursed be the reviler.' Then Umm Hakim bint `Abdul-Muttalib said, `I am a chaste woman so I will not speak abusively and I am refined so I do not know. Both of us are children of the same uncle. And after all the Quraysh know best."" This is the end of the Tafsir of this Surah, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>"

6222,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Reason for the Revelation of this Surah and its Virtues</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Ubayy bin Ka`b that the idolators said to the Prophet , ""O Muhammad! Tell us the lineage of your Lord."" So Allah revealed</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</p><p>Similar was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir and they added in their narration that he said,</p><p>الصَّمَدُ</p><p>(As-Samad) is One Who does not give birth, nor was He born, because there is nothing that is born except that it will die, and there is nothing that dies except that it leaves behind inheritance, and indeed Allah does not die and He does not leave behind any inheritance.</p><p>وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ</p><p>(And there is none comparable to Him.) This means that there is none similar to Him, none equal to Him and there is nothing at all like Him."" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded it and At-Tirmidhi mentioned it as a Mursal narration. Then At-Tirmidhi said, ""And this is the most correct.""</p><h2>A Hadith on its Virtues</h2><p>Al-Bukhari reported from `Amrah bint `Abdur-Rahman, who used to stay in the apartment of `A'ishah, the wife of the Prophet , that `A'ishah said, ""The Prophet sent a man as the commander of a war expedition and he used to lead his companions in prayer with recitation (of the Qur'an). And he would complete his recitation with the recitation of `Say: He is Allah, One.' So when they returned they mentioned that to the Prophet and he said,</p><p>«سَلُوهُ لِأَيِّ شَيْءٍ يَصْنَعُ ذَلِكَ؟»</p><p>(Ask him why does he do that.) So they asked him and he said, `Because it is the description of Ar-Rahman and I love to recite it. So the Prophet said,</p><p>«أَخْبِرُوهُ أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يُحِبُّه»</p><p>(Inform him that Allah the Most High loves him.)"" This is how Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in his Book of Tawhid. Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. In his Book of Salah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said, ""A man from the Ansar used to lead the people in prayer in the Masjid of Quba'. Whenever he began a Surah in the recitation of the prayer that he was leading them, he would start by reciting `Say: He is Allah, One' until he completed the entire Surah. Then he would recite another Surah along with it (after it). And used to do this in every Rak`ah. So his companions spoke to him about this saying; `Verily, you begin the prayer with this Surah. Then you think that it is not sufficient for you unless you recite another Surah as well. So you should either recite it or leave it and recite another Surah instead.' The man replied, `I will not leave it off. If you want me to continue leading you (in prayer), I will do this; and if you all do not like it, I will leave you (i.e., I will stop leading you).' They used to consider him to be of the best of them to lead them in prayer and they did not want anyone else to lead them other than him. So, when the Prophet came they informed him of this information and he said,</p><p>«يَا فُلَانُ، مَا يَمْنَعُكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ مَا يَأْمُرُكَ بِهِ أَصْحَابُكَ، وَمَا حَمَلَكَ عَلَى لُزُوم هَذِهِ السُّورَةِ فِي كُلِّ رَكْعَةٍ؟»</p><p>(O so-and-so! What prevents you from doing what your companions are commanding you to do, and what makes you adhere to the recitation of this Surah in every Rak`ah) The man said, `Verily, I love it.' The Prophet replied,</p><p>«حُبُّكَ إِيَّاهَا أَدْخَلَكَ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Your love of it will cause you to enter Paradise.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, with a disconnected chain, but in a manner indicating his approval.</p><h2>A Hadith that mentions this Surah is equivalent to a Third of the Qur'an</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa`id that a man heard another man reciting</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>(Say: ""He is Allah, One."") and he was repeating over and over. So when morning came, the man went to the Prophet and mentioned that to him, and it was as though he was belittling it. The Prophet said,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ إِنَّهَا لَتَعْدِلُ ثُلُثَ الْقُرْآن»</p><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my soul, verily it is equivalent to a third of the Qur'an.) Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. Another Hadith Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa`id, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«أَيَعْجِزُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ يَقْرَأَ ثُلُثَ الْقُرْآنِ فِي لَيْلَةٍ»</p><p>(Is one of you not able to recite a third of the Qur'an in a single night) This was something that was difficult for them and they said, ""Which of us is able to do that, O Messenger of Allah"" So he replied,</p><p>«اللهُ الْوَاحِدُ الصَّمَدُ ثُلُثُ الْقُرْآن»</p><p>(""Allah is the One, As-Samad"" is a third of the Qur'an.) Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith.</p><h2>Another Hadith that its Recitation necessitates Admission into Paradise</h2><p>Imam Malik bin Anas recorded from `Ubayd bin Hunayn that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying, ""I went out with the Prophet and he heard a man reciting `Say: He is Allah, the One.' So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَجَبَت»</p><p>(It is obligatory.) I asked, `What is obligatory' He replied,</p><p>«الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Paradise.)"" At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it by way of Malik, and At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih Gharib. We do not know of it except as a narration of Malik."" The Hadith in which the Prophet said,</p><p>«حُبُّكَ إِيَّاهَا أَدْخَلَكَ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Your love of it will cause you to enter Paradise.) has already been mentioned.</p><h2>A Hadith about repeating this Surah</h2><p>`Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad recorded from Mu`adh bin `Abdullah bin Khubayb, who reported that his father said, ""We became thirsty and it had become dark while we were waiting for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to lead us in prayer. Then, when he came out he took me by my hand and said,</p><p>«قُل»</p><p>(Say.) Then he was silent. Then he said again,</p><p>«قُل»</p><p>(Say.) So I said, `What should I say' He said,</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>وَالْمُعَوِّذَتَيْنِ حِينَ تُمْسِي وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُ ثَلَاثًا، تَكْفِكَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ مَرَّتَيْن»</p><p>(Say: ""He is Allah, One,"" and the two Surahs of Refuge (Al-Falaq and An-Nas) when you enter upon the evening and the morning three times (each). They will be sufficient for you two times every day.)"" This Hadith was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, ""Hasan Sahih Gharib."" An-Nasa'i also recorded through another chain of narrators with the wording,</p><p>«يَكْفِكَ كُلَّ شَيْء»</p><p>(They will suffice you against everything.)</p><h2>Another Hadith about supplicating with it by Allah's Names</h2><p>In his Book of Tafsir, An-Nasa'i recorded from `Abdullah bin Buraydah, who reported from his father that he entered the Masjid with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and there was a man praying and supplicating saying, ""O Allah! Verily, I ask you by my testifying that there is no God worthy of worship except You. You are the One, the Self-Sufficient Sustainer of all, Who does not give birth, nor were You born, and there is none comparable to Him."" The Prophet said,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَقَدْ سَأَلَهُ بِاسْمِهِ الْأَعْظَم، الَّذِي إِذَ</p><h2>A Hadith about seeking a Cure by these Surahs</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah that whenever the Prophet would go to bed every night, he would put his palms together and blow into them. Then he would recite into them (his palms), `Say: He is Allah, One', `Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Al-Falaq', and `Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.' Then he would wipe whatever he was able to of his body with them (his palms). He would begin wiping his head and face with them and the front part of his body. He would do this (wiping his body) three times. The Sunan compilers also recorded this same Hadith.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ - اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ - لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ - وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ</p><p>(1. Say: ""He is Allah, One."") (2. ""Allah As-Samad."") (3. ""He begets not, nor was He begotten."") (4. ""And there is none comparable to Him."") The reason for the revelation of this Surah has already been mentioned. `Ikrimah said, ""When the Jews said, `We worship `Uzayr, the son of Allah,' and the Christians said, `We worship the Messiah (`Isa), the son of Allah,' and the Zoroastrians said, `We worship the sun and the moon,' and the idolators said, `We worship idols,' Allah revealed to His Messenger ,</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p>(Say: ""He is Allah, One."") meaning, He is the One, the Singular, Who has no peer, no assistant, no rival, no equal and none comparable to Him. This word (Al-Ahad) cannot be used for anyone in affirmation except Allah the Mighty and Majestic, because He is perfect in all of His attributes and actions. Concerning His saying,</p><p>اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ</p><p>(Allah As-Samad.) `Ikrimah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, ""This means the One Who all of the creation depends upon for their needs and their requests."" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, ""He is the Master Who is perfect in His sovereignty, the Most Noble Who is perfect in His nobility, the Most Magnificent Who is perfect in His magnificence, the Most Forbearing Who is perfect in His forbearance, the All-Knowing Who is perfect in His knowledge, and the Most Wise Who is perfect in His wisdom. He is the One Who is perfect in all aspects of nobility and authority. He is Allah, glory be unto Him. These attributes are not befitting anyone other than Him. He has no coequal and nothing is like Him. Glory be to Allah, the One, the Irresistible."" Al-A`mash reported from Shaqiq, who said that Abu Wa'il said,</p><p>الصَّمَدُ</p><p>(As-Samad.) is the Master Whose control is complete.""</p><h2>Allah is Above having Children and procreating</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><p>لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ - وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ</p><p>(He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none comparable to Him.) meaning, He does not have any child, parent or spouse. Mujahid said,</p><p>وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ</p><p>(And there is none comparable to Him.) ""This means He does not have a spouse."" This is as Allah says,</p><p>بَدِيعُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ تَكُنْ لَّهُ صَـحِبَةٌ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ</p><p>(He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife He created all things.) (6:101) meaning, He owns everything and He created everything. So how can He have a peer among His creatures who can be equal to Him, or a relative who can resemble Him Glorified, Exalted and far removed is Allah from such a thing. Allah says,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً - لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئاً إِدّاً - تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً - وَمَا يَنبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَـنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً - إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً</p><p>(And they say: Ar-Rahman has begotten a son. Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, that they ascribe a son to Ar-Rahman. But it is not suitable for Ar-Rahman that He should beget a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto Ar-Rahman as a slave. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And all of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:88-95) And Allah says,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ - لاَ يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And they say: ""Ar-Rahman has begotten a son. Glory to Him! They are but honored servants. They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His command.) (21:26-27) Allah also says,</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ-</p><p>(And they have invented a kinship between Him and the Jinn, but the Jinn know well that they have indeed to appear before Him. Glorified is Allah! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!) (37:158-159) In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded (that that the Prophet said),</p><p>«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذًى سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ، يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا، وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</p><p>(There is no one more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. They attribute a son to Him, while it is He Who gives them sustenance and cures them.) Al-Bukhari also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: كَذَّبَنِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ ذَلِكَ، وَشَتَمَنِي وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ ذَلِكَ، فَأَمَّا تَكْذِيبُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ: لَنْ يُعِيدَنِي كَمَا بَدَأَنِي، وَلَيْسَ أَوَّلُ الْخَلْقِ بِأَهْوَنَ عَلَيَّ مِنْ إِعَادَتِهِ، وَأَمَّا شَتْمُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ: اتَّخَذَ اللهُ وَلَدًا، وَأَنَا الْأَحَدُ الصَّمَدُ، لَمْ أَلِدْ وَلَمْ أُولَدْ، وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لِي كُفُوًا أَحَد»</p><p>(Allah the Mighty and Majestic says, ""The Son of Adam denies Me and he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me and he has no right to do so. In reference to his denial of Me, it is his saying: `He (Allah) will never re-create me like He created me before.' But the re-creation of him is easier than his original creation. As for his cursing Me, it is his saying: `Allah has taken a son.' But I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master. I do not give birth, nor was I born, and there is none comparable to Me."") This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Ikhlas, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>"

He said that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ took me by my hand and showed me the moon when it rose, and he said,</p><p>«تَعَوَّذِي بِاللهِ مِنْ شَرِّ هَذَا الْغَاسِقِ إِذَا وَقَبَ»</p><p>(Seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this Ghasiq when it becomes dark.)"" At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i both recorded this Hadith in their Books of Tafsir in their Sunans. Allah said,</p><p>وَمِن شَرِّ النَّفَّـثَـتِ فِى الْعُقَدِ</p><p>(And from the evil of the blowers in knots,) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak all said, ""This means the witches."" Mujahid said, ""When they perform their spells and blow into the knots.""</p><p>In another Hadith it has been reported that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, ""Are you suffering from any ailment, O Muhammad"" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«نَعَمْ»</p><p>(Yes.) So Jibril said, ""In the Name of Allah, I recite prayer (Ruqyah) over you, from every illness that harms you, from the evil of every envious person and evil eye. May Allah cure you.""</p><h2>Discussion of the Bewitchment of the Prophet</h2><p>In the Book of Medicine of his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was bewitched until he thought that he had relations with his wives, but he had not had relations with them."" Sufyan said, ""This is the worst form of magic when it reaches this stage."" So the Prophet said,</p><p>«يَا عَائِشَةُ، أَعَلِمْتِ أَنَّ اللهَ قَدْ أَفْتَانِي فِيمَا اسْتَفْتَيْتُهُ فِيهِ؟ أَتَانِي رَجُلَانِ فَقَعَدَ أَحَدُهُمَا عِنْدَ رَأْسِي وَالْاخَرُ عِنْدَ رِجْلَيَّ، فَقَال الَّذِي عِنْدَ رَأْسِي لِلْاخَرِ: مَا بَالُ الرَّجُلِ؟ قَالَ: مَطْبُوبٌ، قَالَ: وَمَنْ طَبَّهُ، قَالَ: لَبِيدُ بْنُ أَعْصَمَ: رَجُلٌ مِنْ بَنِي زُرَيْقٍ حَلِيفٌ لِيَهُودَ، كَانَ مُنَافِقًا، قَالَ: وَفِيمَ؟ قَالَ: فِي مُشْطٍ وَمُشَاطَةٍ، قَالَ: وَأَيْنَ؟ قَالَ: فِي جُفِّ طَلْعَةٍ ذَكَرٍ، تَحْتَ رَاعُوفَةٍ فِي بِئْرِ ذَرْوَانَ»</p><p>(O `A'ishah! Do you know that Allah has answered me concerning that which I asked Him Two men came to me and one of them sat by my head while the other sat by my feet. The one who was sitting by my head said to the other one, `What is wrong with this man' The other replied, `He is bewitched.' The first one said, `Who bewitched him' The other replied, `Labid bin A`sam. He is a man from the tribe of Banu Zurayq who is an ally of the Jews, and a hypocrite.' The first one asked, `With what (did he bewitch him)' The other replied, `With a comb and hair from the comb.' The first one asked, `Where (is the comb)' The other answered, `In the dried bark of a male date palm under a rock in a well called Dharwan.') `A'ishah said, ""So he went to the well to remove it (the comb with the hair). Then he said,</p><p>«هَذِهِ الْبِئْرُ الَّتِي أُرِيتُهَا، وَكَأَنَّ مَاءَهَا نُقَاعَةُ الحِنَّاءِ،وَكَأَنَّ نَخْلَهَا رُؤُوسُ الشَّيَاطِين»</p><p>(This is the well that I saw. It was as if its water had henna soaked in it and its palm trees were like the heads of devils.) So he removed it (of the well). Then I (`A'ishah) said, `Will you not make this public' He replied,</p><p>«أَمَّا اللهُ فَقَدْ شَفَانِي، وَأَكْرَهُ أَنْ أُثِيرَ عَلَى أَحَدٍ مِنَ النَّاسِ شَرًّا»</p><p>(Allah has cured me and I hate to spread (the news of) wickedness to any of the people.)""</p>"

6231,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p>These are three attributes from the attributes of the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. They are lordship, sovereignty and divinity. Thus, He is the Lord of everything, the King of everything and the God of everything. All things are created by Him, owned by Him, and subservient to Him. Therefore, He commands whoever is seeking protection to seek refuge with the One Who has these attributes from the evil of the whisperer who withdraws. This (the whisperer) is the devil that is assigned to man. For verily, there is not any of the Children of Adam except that he has a companion that beautifies wicked deeds for him. This devil will go to any lengths to confuse and confound him. The only person who is safe is He Whom Allah protects.</p><p>It is confirmed in the Sahih that he (the Prophet ) said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا قَدْ وُكِّلَ بِهِ قَرِينُهُ»</p><p>(There is not a single one of you except that his companion (a devil) has been assigned to him.) They (the Companions) said, ""What about you, O Messenger of Allah"" He replied,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، إِلَّا أَنَّ اللهَ أَعَانَنِي عَلَيْهِ فَأَسْلَمَ، فَلَا يَأْمُرُنِي إِلَّا بِخَيْرٍ»</p><p>(Yes. However, Allah has helped me against him and he has accepted Islam. Thus, he only commands me to do good.) It is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Anas, who reported the story of Safiyyah when she came to visit the Prophet while he was performing I`tikaf, that he went out with her during the night to walk her back to her house. So, two men from the Ansar met him (on the way). When they saw the Prophet , they began walking swiftly. So, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«عَلَى رِسْلِكُمَا، إِنَّهَا صَفِيَّةُ بِنْتُ حُيَيَ»</p><p>(Slow down! This is Safiyyah bint Huyay!) They said, ""Glory be to Allah, O Messenger of Allah!"" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ يَجْرِي مِنِ ابْنِ آدَمَ مَجْرَى الدَّم، وَإِنِّي خَشِيتُ أَنْ يَقْذِفَ فِي قُلُوبِكُمَا شَيْئًا، أَوْ قَالَ: شَرًّا»</p><p>(Verily, Shaytan runs in the Son of Adam like the running of the blood. And verily, I feared that he might cast something into your hearts -- or he said -- evil.) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</p><p>(The whisperer (Al-Waswas) who withdraws.) ""The devil who is squatting (perched) upon the heart of the Son of Adam. So when he becomes absentminded and heedless he whispers. Then, when he remembers Allah he withdraws."" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.</p><p>Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman reported that his father said, ""It has been mentioned to me that Shaytan is Al-Waswas. He blows into the heart of the Son of Adam when he is sad and when he is happy. But when he (man) remembers Allah, Shaytan withdraws."" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>الْوَسْوَاسِ</p><p>(The whisperer.) ""He is Shaytan. He whispers and then when he is obeyed, he withdraws."" As for Allah's saying;</p><p>الَّذِى يُوَسْوِسُ فِى صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</p><p>(Who whispers in the breasts of An-Nas.) Is this specific for the Children of Adam as is apparent, or is it general, including both mankind and Jinns</p><p>There are two views concerning this. This is because they (the Jinns) are also included in the usage of the word An-Nas (the people) in most cases.</p><p>Ibn Jarir said, ""The phrase Rijalun min Al-Jinn (Men from the Jinns) has been used in reference to them, so it is not strange for the word An-Nas to be applied to them also."" Then Allah says,</p><p>مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ</p><p>(Of Jinn and An-Nas.) Is this explanatory of Allah's statement,</p><p>الَّذِى يُوَسْوِسُ فِى صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</p><p>(Who whispers in the breasts of An-Nas.) Then, Allah explains this by saying,</p><p>مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ</p><p>(Of Jinn and An-Nas.) This is supportive of the second view. It has also been said that Allah's saying,</p><p>مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ</p><p>(Of Jinn and An-Nas) is an explanation of who is it that whispers into the breasts of mankind from the devils of mankind and Jinns. This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نِبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً شَيَـطِينَ الإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ يُوحِى بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُوراً</p><p>o(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies -- Shayatin among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion.) (6:112) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, ""A man came to the Prophet and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Sometimes I say things to myself that I would rather fall from the sky than say (aloud openly). ' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللهُ أَكْبَرُ، اللهُ أَكْبَرٌ الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي رَدَّ كَيْدَهُ إِلَى الْوَسْوَسَةِ»</p><p>(Allah is Most Great! Allah is Most Great! All praise is due to Allah Who sent his (Shaytan's) plot back as only a whisper.)"" Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.</p>"
