8,Alif. Lām. Mīm.,
9,"This Book has no doubt in it - a guidance for the God-fearing,",
10,"who believe in the Unseen, and are steadfast in Salāh (prayer), and spend out of what We have provided them;",
11,and who believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you; and they have faith in the Hereafter.,
12,It is these who are guided by their Lord; and it is just these who are successful.,
13,"Surely for those who have disbelieved, it is all the same whether you warn them or you warn them not: they do not believe.",
14,"Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing; and on their eyes there is a covering, and for them awaits a mighty punishment.",
15,"And among men there are some who say, “We believe in Allah and in the Last Day”, yet they are not believers.",
16,"They try to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they are not deceiving anyone except themselves, although they are unaware of it.",
17,"In their hearts there is a malady, so Allah has made them grow in their malady; and for them there is a grievous punishment, because they have been lying.",
18,"When it is said to them, “Do not spread disorder on the earth”, they say, “We are but reformers.”",
19,"Beware, it is, in fact, they who spread disorder, but they do not appreciate.",
20,"And when it is said to them, “Believe as people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools have believed?” Beware, it is, in fact, they who are the fools, but they do not know.",
21,"When they meet those who believe, they say, “We have entered Faith;” but when they are alone with their satans, they say, “Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking.”",
22,"It is Allah who mocks at them, and lets them go on wandering blindly in their rebellion.",
23,"These are the people who have bought error at the price of guidance; so their trade has brought no gain, nor have they reached the right Path.",
24,"Their situation is like that of a man who kindles a fire, and when it illuminates everything around him, Allah takes away their lights and leaves them in layers of darkness, so that they see nothing.",
25,"Deaf, dumb and blind, they shall not return.",
26,"Or (it is) like a rainstorm from the sky, bringing darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps for fear of death, -and Allah encompasses the disbelievers.",
27,"and lightning (all but) snatches away their eyesight; every time a flash gives them light, they walk by it; and when darkness falls upon them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He would certainly take away their hearing and their eyes: surely Allah is powerful to do anything.",
28,"O people, worship your Lord who created you and those before you, so that you may become God-fearing.",
29,"He is the One who made the earth a bed for you, and the sky a roof, and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it fruits, as a provision for you. So, do not set up parallels to Allah when you know.",
30,"If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then bring a Sūrah similar to this, and do call your supporters other than Allah, if you are true.",
31,"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then guard yourselves against the Fire, the fuel of which will be men and stones. It has been prepared for disbelievers.",
32,"And give good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds that for them there are gardens beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are given a fruit from there to eat, they will say, “This is what we have been given before”; and they will be given (fruits) resembling one another. And for them there shall be wives purified; and there they will live forever.",
33,"Indeed, Allah does not feel shy in citing any parable, be it that of a gnat or of something above it (in meanness). Now, as for those who believe, they know it is the truth from their Lord; while those who disbelieve say, “What could Allah have meant by this parable?” By this He lets many go astray, and by this He makes many find guidance. But He does not let anyone go astray thereby except those who are sinful",
34,"- those who break the Covenant of Allah after it has been made binding, and cut off the relations Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread disorder on the earth - it is these who are the losers.",
35,"“How is it that you deny Allah, while you were lifeless and He gave you life; then He will make you die, and then He will make you live again, and then to Him you will be returned?",
36,It is He who created for you all that the earth contains; then He turned to the heavens and made them seven skies - and He is the knower of all things.,
37,"(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a deputy on the earth!” They said, “Will You create there one who will spread disorder on the earth and cause bloodshed, while we proclaim Your purity, along with your praise, and sanctify Your name?” He said, “Certainly, I know what you know not.”",
38,"And He taught ’Ādam the names, all of them; then presented them before the angels, and said, “Tell me their names, if you are right.”",
39,"They said, “To You belongs all purity! We have no knowledge except what You have given us. Surely, You alone are the All-knowing, All-wise.”",
40,"He said, “O ’Ādam, tell them the names of all these.” When he told them their names, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the skies and of the earth, and that I know what you disclose and what you conceal.",
41,"And when We said to the angels: “Prostrate yourselves before ’Ādam!” So, they prostrated themselves, all but Iblīs (Satan). He refused, and became one of the infidels.",
42,"And We said, “O ’Ādam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise; and eat at pleasure wherever you like, but do not go near this tree, otherwise you will be (counted) among the transgressors.”",
43,"Then, Satan caused them to slip from it, and brought them out of where they had been. And We said, “Go down, all of you, some of you the enemies of others; and on the earth there will be for you a dwelling place and enjoyment for a time.”",
44,"Then ’Ādam learned certain words (to pray with) from his Lord; so, Allah accepted his repentance. No doubt, He is the Most-Relenting, the Very-Merciful.",
45,"We said, “Go down from here, all of you. Then, should some guidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.",
46,"As for those who disbelieve, and deny Our signs, they are the people of the Fire. They shall dwell in it forever.”",
47,"O Children of Isrā’īl (the Israelites), remember My blessing that I conferred upon you, and fulfill the covenant with Me, and I shall fulfill your covenant, and have awe of Me alone.",
48,"And have faith in what I have revealed, confirming what is already with you, and do not be the first to deny it, nor take a paltry price for My verses. Fear Me alone.",
49,"and do not confound truth with falsehood, and do not hide the truth when you know (it).",
50,"And be steadfast in Salāh (prayer), and pay Zakāh, and bow down with those who bow down.",
51,"Do you enjoin righteousness upon others while you ignore your own selves, although you keep reciting the Book? Have you then no sense?",
52,"Seek help through patience and prayer. It is indeed exacting, but not for those who are humble in their hearts,",
53,"who bear in mind that they are to meet their Lord, and that to Him they are to return.",
54,"O Children of Isrā’īl (Israel), remember My blessing that I conferred upon you, and that I gave you excellence over the worlds;",
55,"and guard yourselves against a day when no one shall stand for anyone in anything, nor shall intercession be accepted on anyone’s behalf, nor shall ransom be taken from him, and neither shall any be given support.",
56,"(Remember) when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh! They had been inflicting on you grievous torment, slaughtering your sons and leaving your women alive. In all that, there was a great trial from your Lord.",
57,"And (recall) when We parted the sea for you; then We saved you, and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on!",
58,"And when We appointed forty nights for Mūsā, then you took the calf (as God) thereafter, and you were unjust.",
59,"Yet We pardoned you, even after that, so that you may show gratitude.",
60,"Then We gave Mūsā the Book and the Criterion (of right and wrong), so that you may find the right path.",
61,"When Mūsā said to his people: “My people, you have wronged yourselves by your taking the calf (as God). So, turn in repentance to your Creator, and slay yourselves. That will be better for you in the sight of your Creator”. Then, He accepted your repentance. Indeed He is the Most-Relenting, the Very-Merciful.",
62,"When you said, “Mūsā, we will never believe you till we see Allah openly!” So, the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.",
63,"Then, We raised you up after your death, so that you might show gratitude.",
64,"And We made the cloud give you shade, and sent down to you Mann and Salwā: “Eat of the good things We have provided to you”. And they (by their ingratitude) did Us no harm, but were harming only themselves.",
65,"When We said, “Enter this town, and eat to your heart’s content wherever you wish in it; and enter the gate prostrating yourselves and say: HiTTah (we seek forgiveness), so that We forgive your errors. And We shall give much more to those who do good.”",
66,"But those who were unjust substituted another word for the one that was prescribed for them. So, We sent down a scourge from heaven upon those who were unjust, because they had acted sinfully.",
67,"When Mūsā sought water for his people, We said, “Strike the rock with your staff,” And twelve springs gushed forth from it. Each group of people came to know their drinking place. “Eat and drink of what Allah has provided, and do not go about the earth spreading disorder.”",
68,"And when you said, “Mūsā , we will no longer confine ourselves to a single food: So, pray for us to your Lord that He may bring forth for us of what the earth grows - of its vegetable, its cucumbers, its wheat, its lentils and its onions.” He said, “Do you want to take what is inferior in exchange for what is better? Go down to a town, and you will have what you ask for.” Then they were stamped with disgrace and misery, and they returned with wrath from Allah. That was because they used to deny the signs of Allah, and would slay the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and transgressed all limits.",
69,"Surely, those who believed in Allah, and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabians, -whosoever believes in Allah and in the Last Day, and does good deeds - all such people will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no reason for them to fear, nor shall they grieve.",
70,"And when We took the pledge from you, and raised high above you the (Mount of) Tūr: “Hold fast to what We have given to you, and remember what is in it, so that you may become God-fearing.”",
71,"Then even after that, you turned away. So, had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.",
72,"Certainly you have knowledge of those among you who transgressed in (the matter of) the Sabbath. We said to them, “Become apes, abased.”",
73,"Thus, We made it a deterrent for those around and (those who came) after them - and a lesson for the God-fearing.",
74,"When Mūsā said to his people, “Allah commands you to slaughter a cow”, they said, “Are you making fun of us?” He said, “I seek refuge with Allah from being one of the ignorant.”",
75,"They said, “Pray for us to your Lord that He makes it clear to us what sort (of cow) should she be.” He said, “He says she should be a cow neither too old, nor too young - of some middle age in between. Now, do what you are being asked to do.”",
76,"They said, “Pray for us to your Lord that He makes it clear to us of what colour it should be.” He said: “He says that she should be a yellow cow, rich yellow in her colour that should please the onlookers.”",
77,"They said, “Pray for us to your Lord that He makes it clear to us of what sort should she be, for this cow has made us confused and, if Allah wills, We shall certainly take the right course.”",
78,"He said, “He says that it should be a cow which is not tractable for tilling the soil or in watering the fields, (and it should be) sound and without blemish.” They said, “Now, you have come up with the right description.” Then they slaughtered her, although it appeared that they would not do it.",
79,"And when you killed a man, and started putting the blame for it on one another, while Allah was to bring forth what you were holding back.",
80,"So, We said, “Strike him with a part of it.” This is how Allah revives the dead; and He shows you His signs, so that you may understand.",
81,"When, even after that, your hearts were hardened, as if they were rocks, or still worse in hardness. For surely among the rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth, and there are others that crack open and water flows from them, and there are still others that fall down in fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
82,"(O Muslims) do you still fancy that they will believe you, although a group of them used to hear the word of Allah, and then, having understood it, used to distort it knowingly?",
83,"When they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe.” But when some of them meet others in private, they say, “Do you tell them (the Muslims) what Allah has disclosed to you so that they may thereby argue against you before your Lord? Will you, then, not use reason?”",
84,Are they not aware that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?,
85,"And some among them are illiterate who have no knowledge of the Book, but have some fancies and do nothing but conjecture.",
86,"So, woe to those who write the Book with their hands and then say, “This is from Allah”, so that they may gain thereby a trifling price. Then, woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.",
87,"They say, “The fire shall not touch us for more than a few days.” Say, “Have you taken a pledge from Allah, and Allah will not go against His promise? Or, do you say about Allah what you do not know?”",
88,"Why not? Those who commit evil and are besieged by their sins, those are people of the Fire - there they shall live forever.",
89,"As for those who believe, and do good deeds, they are the people of Paradise - there they will live forever.",
90,"(Remember) when We took a pledge from the children of Isrā’īl (Israel): “You shall not worship anyone other than Allah; and you shall do good to the parents, and to near of kin, and to orphans and the needy. And say to the people what is good, and be steadfast in Salāh (prayer), and pay Zakāh .” Then, you went back (on your word), all but a few among you, and you are used to turning away.",
91,"When We took a pledge from you: “You shall not shed the blood of one another, and you shall not drive one another out of your homes.” Then you agreed, being yourselves the witnesses.",
92,"Yet, here you are, killing one another, and driving a group of your own people out of their homes, supporting each other against them in sin and aggression - and if they come to you as prisoners, you would ransom them, while their very expulsion was unlawful for you! Do you, then, believe in some parts of the Book, and disbelieve in others? So, what can be the punishment of those among you who do that, except disgrace in present life? And, on the Day of Judgement, they shall be turned to the most severe punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
93,"Those are the ones who bought the worldly life at the cost of the Hereafter. So, punishment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be helped.",
94,"Indeed, We gave Mūsā the Book, and after him We sent messengers, one following the other; and We gave clear signs to ‘Īsā, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary), and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Then, how is it that every time a prophet came to you with what does not meet your desires, you grew arrogant? So, you gave the lie to a group (of the messengers) and killed others.",
95,"And they said, “Our hearts are veiled.” Rather, Allah has cast damnation upon them for their disbelief. So, they believe just in very little things",
96,"And when there came to them a Book from Allah, which confirms what was with them,- while earlier, they used to seek help against those who disbelieved, - yet when there came to them that which they did recognize, they denied it. So the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers.",
97,"Vile is that for which they have sold out their selves: that they should deny what Allah has revealed, grudging that Allah should send down some of His bounty to whomsoever He wills from among His servants. So, they came out with wrath upon wrath. And for the unbelievers, there is humiliating punishment.",
98,"When it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us” - and they deny what is beyond it, whereas that is the truth which confirms what is with them. Say, “Why then have you been slaying the prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers?”",
99,"And certainly Mūsā came to you with clear signs, then you adopted the calf (as god) after his departure (to the mount of Tūr) - and you were transgressors.",
100,"And when We took a pledge from you, and raised high the (mount of) Tūr above you: “Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen”! They said, “We have heard and disobeyed.” And, on account of their denial, they were soaked with love for the calf in their hearts. Say: “Evil is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you are believers.”",
101,"Say: “If the Last Abode near Allah is purely for you, to the exclusion of all people, then make a wish for death, if you are true.”",
102,But they will never wish for it because of what their hands have sent ahead. Allah is All-Aware of the unjust.,
103,"You shall surely find them the more avid, for life than all other men - even more than the polytheists. Every one of them would love that his life is prolonged for one thousand years. But it will not take him away from punishment that his life is (so) prolonged, and Allah is watchful of what they do.",
104,"Say, if someone is an enemy to Jibra’īl (Gabriel) (it can by no means degrade him for) it is he who has brought it (the Qur’ān) down upon your heart by the permission of Allah, confirming what has been before it, and a guidance and good tidings to the believers.",
105,"If someone is an enemy to Allah, His angels, and His messengers, and to Jibra’īl (Gabriel) and Mīka’īl (Michael), then Allah is enemy to the disbelievers.",
106,And certainly We have revealed to you clear signs. And no one denies them except the sinful.,
107,"Would it always be that every time they enter into a pact, a group from among them should throw it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.",
108,"And when a messenger from Allah came to them, confirming what was already with them, some from among the people of the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they did not know.",
109,"They followed what the devils used to recite in the reign of Sulaimān (Solomon); and it was not Sulaimān who became an infidel, but the devils did become infidels, teaching people magic, and what had been sent down to the two angels, Hārūt and Mārūt, in Babylon. And these two did not teach anyone without first having said (to him), “We are but a trial, so do not go infidel.” Then, they used to learn from them that with which they could cause separation between a man and his wife. But they were not to bring harm through it to anyone without the will of Allah.They used to learn what harmed them and did no good to them; and they certainly knew that he who buys it has no share in the Hereafter. And, indeed, vile is the thing for which they sold themselves away. If only they knew!",
110,"And had they accepted the faith, and been God-fearing, the reward from Allah would have always been far better. If only they knew!",
111,"O you who believe, do not say Rā‘inā, but say UnZurnā, and listen, as there is a grievous punishment for the unbelievers.",
112,"Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Book and the idolaters do not like that any good should come to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses for His grace whomsoever He wills, and Allah is the Lord of great bounty.",
113,"Whenever We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or one equal to it. Do you not know that Allah is powerful over everything?",
114,"Do you not know that to Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? Other than Allah, you have neither a patron, nor a helper.",
115,"Or, do you rather want to question your Prophet as Mūsā was questioned earlier? And whoever takes infidelity in exchange for faith has certainly missed the straight path.",
116,"(O Muslims,) many among the people of the Book desire to turn you, after your accepting the faith, back into disbelievers - all out of envy on their part, even after the truth has become clear to them. So, forgive and overlook till Allah brings out His command. Certainly, Allah is powerful over everything.",
117,"And be steadfast in Salāh (prayer), and give Zakāh. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah. Certainly, Allah is watchful of what you do.",
118,"They say that no one shall ever enter Paradise unless he is a Jew, or a Christian. These are their fancies. Say, “Bring your proof, if you are truthful.”",
119,"Of course, whosoever submits his face to Allah, and is good in deeds, will have his reward with his Lord, and there shall be no fear for such people, nor shall they grieve.",
120,"The Jews say: “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say “The Jews have nothing to stand on” while they both read the Book! Similarly, those who do not know have said like they (the Jews and the Christians) say. So, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection in what they used to dispute.",
121,"Who is more cruel than the one who prevents the mosques of Allah from His name being recited therein, and strives for their destruction? It was not for such men to enter them except in awe. For them there is disgrace in this world, and for them there is a mighty punishment in the other world.",
122,"To Allah belongs the East and the West. So, whichever way you turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.",
123,"They say: “Allah has got a son.” Pure is He. Instead, to Him belongs all that there is in the heavens and the earth. All stand obedient to Him.",
124,"(He is the) Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decides a matter, He simply says to it: “Be”, and it comes to be.",
125,"Those who do not know say: “Why is it that Allah does not speak to us, nor does a sign come to us?” So spoke those before them as these people do. Their hearts resemble each other. We have indeed made the signs clear for the people who have certitude.",
126,"Surely, We have sent you with the truth, as a bearer of good tidings, and a warner, and you will not be asked about the people of Hell.",
127,"The Jews will never be pleased with you, nor will the Christians, unless you follow their faith. Say: “Guidance of Allah is, indeed, the guidance.” Were you to follow their desires despite the knowledge that has come to you, there shall be no friend for you against Allah, nor a helper.",
128,"Those to whom We have given the Book and they recite it observing the rights of its recitation - they are the ones who believe in it. And those who disbelieve in it, they are the losers.",
129,"O children of Isrā’īl (Israel), remember My blessing that I conferred upon you, and that I gave you excellence over the worlds.",
130,"And guard yourselves against a day when no one shall stand for anyone for anything, nor shall ransom be accepted from anyone, nor shall intercession be of benefit to him, nor shall any support be given to such people.",
131,"When his Lord put Ibrāhīm to a test with certain Words, and he fulfilled them, He said, “I am going to make you an Imām for the people.”He said, “And from among my progeny?” He replied, “My promise does not extend to the unjust.”",
132,"When We made the House (Ka‘bah of Makkah) a frequented place for men, and a place of peace! Make from the Station of Ibrāhīm a place of prayer. We gave the (following directive) to Ibrāhīm and Ismā‘īl (Ishmael): “Purify My House for those who are to circumambulate (make Tawāf) and those who stay in I‘tikāf, and those who bow down or prostrate themselves (in prayers).",
133,"(Recall) when Ibrāhīm said, “My Lord, make this a city of peace, and provide its people with fruits - those of them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” He (Allah) said, “As for the one who disbelieves, I shall let him enjoy a little, then I shall drag him to the punishment of the Fire. How evil an end it is!",
134,"When Ibrāhīm was raising up the foundations of the House, along with Ismā‘īl (Ishmael) (supplicating): “Our Lord accept (this service) from us! Indeed, You - and You alone - are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing!",
135,"Our Lord, make us both submissive to You, and (make) of our progeny as well, a people submissive to You and show us our ways of Pilgrimage and accept our repentance. Indeed, You - and You alone - are the Most-Relenting, the Very-Merciful.",
136,"And, our Lord, raise in their midst a Messenger from among them, who should recite to them Your verses, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and cleanse them of all impurities. Indeed You, and You alone, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”",
137,Who can turn away from the faith of Ibrāhīm except the one who has debased himself in folly? Indeed We have chosen him in this world. And he is certainly among the righteous in the Hereafter.,
138,"When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He said, “I submit myself to the Lord of all the worlds.”",
139,"And Ibrāhīm exhorted the same to his sons, and so did Ya‘qūb (Jacob): “My sons, Allah has certainly chosen for you the Faith. So, let not death overtake you but as Muslims.”",
140,"Is it that you were present when death approached Ya‘qūb, when he said to his sons: “What will you worship after me”? They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Ibrāhīm, Ismā‘īl (Ishmael) and IsHāq (Isaac), the one God, and to Him we submit ourselves.”",
141,"Those are a people who have passed away. For them is what they earned, and for you is what you earned. Nor shall you be questioned as to what they have been doing.",
142,"They said, “Become Jews or Christians, and you will find the right path.” Say: “Instead, (we follow) the faith of Ibrāhīm, the upright, - and he was not one of those who associate partners with Allah.”",
143,"Say (O, Muslims): “We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us, and in what has been revealed to Ibrāhīm, Ismā‘īl (Ishmael), IsHāq (Isaac), Ya‘qūb and his children, and in what has been given to Mūsā and ‘Īsā (Jesus) and what has been given to the prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between any of them, and to Him we submit ourselves.”",
144,"So, if they believe in the same way as you believe, they will have certainly found the right path, and if they turn away, then the fact is that they are in antagonism. Then Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
145,(We dye ourselves with) the colouring of Allah! For who is better in colouring than Allah? We are to worship none but Him.,
146,"Say: “Would you argue with us about Allah, when He is our Lord as well as your Lord? For us our deeds, and for you your deeds! And we are faithful to Him.",
147,"Or, would you say that Ibrāhīm, Ismā‘īl, IsHāq, Ya‘qūb and their children were Jews or Christians?” Say: “Do you know better or does Allah?” Who can be more unjust than the one who conceals the testimony he has from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
148,"Those are a people who have passed away. For them is what they earned, and for you is what you earned, and you shall not be questioned about what they have been doing.",
149,The foolish among the people will say: “What has turned them away from their Qiblah which they used to observe?” Say: “To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.”,
150,"In the same way We made you a moderate Ummah (community), so that you should be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger a witness to you.And We did not prescribe the Qiblah which you used to observe except to know the one who follows the Messenger as distinct from the one who turns on his heels. It was burdensome indeed, but not on those whom Allah guided. Allah will not allow your faith go to waste. Certainly Allah is very kind, very merciful to the people.",
151,"We have been seeing you turning your face to the heavens. So, We will certainly assign to you a Qiblah that you would like. Now, turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Harām), and (O Muslims), wherever you are, turn your faces in its direction. Even those who have been given the Book know well that it is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what they do.",
152,"Even if you bring every sign to those who have been given the Book, they would not follow your Qiblah, and you are not to follow their Qiblah, nor are they to follow each other’s Qiblah. If you were to follow their desires despite the knowledge that has come to you, you will then certainly be among the unjust.",
153,"Those whom We have given the Book recognize him (the Holy Prophet) as they recognize their own sons. In fact, a group of them conceals the truth, while they know (it).",
154,"The truth is from your Lord. So, never be among those who doubt (it).”",

Have two witnesses from among your men, and if two men are not there, then one man and two women from those witnesses whom you like, so that if one of the two women errs, the other woman may remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when summoned. And do not be weary of writing it down, along with its due date, no matter whether the debt is small or large. That is more equitable in Allah’s sight, and more supportive as evidence, and more likely to make you free of doubt. However, if it is a spot transaction you are effecting between yourselves, there is no sin on you, should you not write it. Have witnesses when you transact a sale.

694,"He said, “O my Lord, I have no control except over myself and my brother. So, make a distinction between us and the sinning people.”",
695,"He (Allah) said, “This (land) is prohibited to them for forty years. They shall be wandering around the earth. So, do not grieve for the sinning people.”",
696,"And recite to them the story of the two sons of ’Ādam rightly: When both of them offered a sacrifice, it was accepted from one of them, and was not accepted from the other. He said, “I will kill you.” He said, “Allah accepts only from the God-fearing.",
697,"If you stretch your hand towards me to kill me, I am not going to stretch my hand towards you to kill you. Indeed, I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.",

699,"His self, however, prompted him to kill his brother, so he killed him and became one of the losers.",
700,"Then, Allah sent a crow that scratched the earth to show him how he should conceal the corpse of his brother. He said, “Alas! Was I not even able to be like this crow so that I could conceal the corpse of my brother? So, he stood regretful.",
701,"For this reason, We decreed for the children of Isrā’īl that whoever kills a person not in retaliation for a person killed, nor (as a punishment) for spreading disorder on the earth, is as if he has killed the whole of humankind, and whoever saves the life of a person is as if he has saved the life of the whole of humankind. Certainly, Our messengers have come to them with clear signs. Then, after all that, many of them are there to commit excesses on the earth.",
702,"Those who fight against Allah and His Messenger and run about trying to spread disorder on the earth, their punishment is no other than that they shall be killed, or be crucified, or their hands and legs be cut off from different sides, or they be kept away from the land (they live in). That is a humiliation for them in this world, and for them there is a great punishment in the Hereafter;",

709,Do you not know that to Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whomsoever He wills and forgives whomsoever He wills. Allah is powerful over everything.,
710,"O Messenger, those who race towards disbelief should not be a cause of grief for you, be they from those who say with their mouths, “We believe”, while their hearts do not believe, or from those who are (pronounced) Jews. They are listeners to the fallacy, listeners to other people who did not come to you. They distort the words after they had been properly placed. They say, “If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, then avoid it.” The one whom Allah wills to put to trial, you cannot do anything for him against Allah. They are the ones whose hearts Allah did not intend to purify. For them there is humiliation in this world, and for them there is a great punishment in the Hereafter.",
711,"They are listeners to the fallacy, devourers of the unlawful. So, if they come to you, judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they can do you no harm. But if you judge, judge between them with justice. Surely, Allah loves those who do justice.",
712,"How do they ask you to judge while the Torah is with them, having the ruling of Allah? Still, they turn away, after all that. They are no believers.",
713,"Surely We have sent down the Torah, in which there was guidance and light by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, used to judge for the Jews, and (so did) the Men of Allah and the Men of knowledge, because they were ordained to protect the Book of Allah, and they stood guard over it. So, (O Jews of today,) do not fear people. Fear Me, and do not take a paltry price for My verses. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down are the disbelievers.",
714,"We prescribed for them therein: A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear and a tooth for a tooth; and for wounds, an equal retaliation. Then, if one forgives it, that will be expiation for him. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down, they are the unjust.",
715,"We sent ‘Īsā son of Maryam after those prophets, confirming the Torah that was (revealed) before him, and We gave him the Injīl having guidance and light therein, and confirming the Torah that was (revealed) before it; a guidance and a lesson for the God-fearing.",
716,"And the people of the Injīl must judge according to what Allah has sent down therein. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down, they are the sinners.",
717,"We have sent down to you the Book with truth, confirming the Book before it, and a protector for it. So, judge between them according to what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires against the truth that has come to you. For each of you We have made a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made a single community of people, but (He did not), so that He may test you in what He has given to you. Strive, then, to excel each other in good deeds. To Allah is the return for all of you. Then Allah shall tell you about that in which you disputed.",
718,"We order you to judge between them according to what Allah has sent down. Do not follow their desires, and beware of them, lest they should turn you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you. If they turn away, be assured that Allah intends to make them suffer for some of their sins. Surely, many of the people are sinners.",

721,"Now, you see those who have disease in their hearts race towards them saying, “We apprehend that some misfortune may overtake us.”So, it is likely that Allah may bring victory or something else from His own side, whereupon they will become regretful over what they concealed in their hearts.",
722,"Those who believe will say, “Are these the ones who swore their solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you?” Their deeds have gone to waste, and they became losers.",
723,"O you who believe, if anyone from you turns back from his Faith, then Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, humble toward the believers, hard on the disbelievers, who fight in the way of Allah and are not afraid of the reproach of any critic. That is a grace of Allah. He confers it on whom He wills. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing",

They are those whom Allah has subjected to His curse and to His wrath; and He has turned some of them into apes and swine, those who worshipped Tāghūt (Satan, the Rebel). Those are worse in their situation, and far more astray from the straight path.”",

732,Why do the Men of Allah and the Men of Knowledge not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful? Evil indeed is what they have been working.,
733,"The Jews said, “Allah’s hand is fettered.” Fettered are their own hands, and cursed are they for what they said. In fact, His hands are outspread. He spends as He wills. What has been sent down to you from your Lord shall certainly increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them lasting to the Day of Doom. Whenever they lit the flame of war, Allah puts it out. They run about on the earth spreading mischief, and Allah does not like the mischief-makers.",
734,"If the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would have written off their evil deeds and would have surely admitted them to the Gardens of Bliss.",

737,"Say, “O people of the Book, you have nothing to stand on, unless you uphold the Torah and the Injīl and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.” What has been sent down to you from your Lord will certainly make many of them more persistent in rebellion and disbelief. So, do not grieve over the disbelieving people.",
738,"Surely, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians - whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and acts righteously, shall have no fear, nor shall such people grieve.",
739,"Certainly We took a pledge from the children of Isrā’īl and sent Messengers to them. Whenever a Messenger went to them with what did not meet their desires, they cried lie to some, and killed others.",
740,"They thought that no harm would follow. Therefore, they became blind and deaf. Then, Allah accepted their repentance, but again they turned blind and deaf, many of them. Allah is watchful of what they do.",
741,"Surely, disbelievers are those who say, “Allah is the MasīH, son of Maryam” while the MasīH had said, “O children of Isrā’īl , worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” In fact, whoever ascribes any partner to Allah, Allah has prohibited for him the Jannah (the Paradise), and his shelter is the Fire, and there will be no supporters for the unjust.",
742,"Surely, disbelievers are those who say, “Allah is the third of the three” while there is no god but One God. If they do not desist from what they say, a painful punishment shall certainly befall such disbelievers.",
743,"Why then do they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness, while Allah is most forgiving, very merciful?",
744,"The MasīH, son of Maryam, is no more than a Messenger. There have been messengers before him. His mother was very truthful. Both of them used to eat food. Look how We explain signs to them, then see how far they are turned away.",

747,"On those who disbelieve from among the children of Isrā’īl , a curse was pronounced by Dawūd and ‘Īsā, Son of Maryam. All this because they disobeyed and used to cross the limits",
748,They did not forbid each other from any evil they committed. Evil indeed is what they have been doing.,
749,"You see many of them take the infidels (the pagans) for friends. Indeed, evil is what they have sent ahead for themselves, for Allah is angry with them, and they are to remain in torment for ever.",
750,"If they believed in Allah, in the prophet, and in what had been sent down to him, they would have not taken them (the pagans) for friends, but many of them are sinners.",
751,"And you will certainly find that the people most hostile against the believers are the Jews and the ones who ascribe partners to Allah. You will certainly find that the closest of them in friendship with the believers are those who say, “We are Christians.”That is because among them there are priests and monks, and because they are not arrogant.",
752,"When they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say, “Our Lord, we have come to believe. So, record us along with those who bear witness.",
753,"What excuse do we have if we do not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us, while we hope that our Lord will admit us to the company of the righteous people?”",
754,"So, because of what they said, Allah has awarded them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will live forever. That is the reward of those who are good in their deeds.",
755,"But those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, they are the people of the Fire.",
756,"O you who believe, do not hold as unlawful the good things that Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.",
757,"Eat from what Allah has provided you as good and lawful, and fear Allah in whom you believe.",
758,"Allah does not hold you accountable for your laghw (ineffectual) oaths, but He does hold you accountable for the oath with which you have bound yourself. Its expiation is to feed ten poor persons at an average of what you feed your family with, or to clothe them, or to free a slave. However, if someone cannot afford, he has to fast for three days. That is expiation for the oaths that you have sworn. Take care of your oaths. That is how Allah makes His signs clear to you, so that you may be grateful.",
759,"O you who believe! Wine, gambling, altars and divining arrows are filth, made up by Satan. Therefore, refrain from it, so that you may be successful.",
760,"Satan wishes only to plant enmity and malice between you through wine and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from Salāh. Would you, then, abstain?",

762,"There is no sin, for those who believe and do good deeds, in what they might have partaken earlier, if they fear Allah, and believe, and do good deeds; and again fear Allah, and believe, and still again fear Allah and do good deeds. Allah loves those who are good in their deeds.",
763,"O you who believe, Allah shall certainly test you with some of the game coming in the range of your hands and spears, so that Allah may know those who fear Him, even though He is Unseen. Whoever transgresses the limit after all this, for him there is a painful punishment.",
764,"O you who believe, do not kill game when you are in IHrām (state of consecration for Hajj or ‘Umrah). If someone from among you kills it deliberately, then compensation (will be required) from cattle equal to what one has killed, according to the judgement of two just men from among you, as an offering due to reach the Ka’bah, or an expiation, that is, to feed the poor, or its equal in fasts, so that he may taste the punishment of what he did. Allah has forgiven what has passed, but whoever does it again, Allah shall subject him to retribution. Allah is Mighty, Lord of Retribution.",
765,"Made lawful for you is the game of the sea and eating thereof, as a benefit for you and for travellers. But the game of the land has been made unlawful for you as long as you are in the state of IHrām. Fear Allah (the One) towards Whom you are to be brought together.",
766,"Allah has made the Ka’bah, the Sacred House, a source of stability for people, and also the sacred month and the sacrificial animal and the garlands. All this is because you may learn that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Allah is All-Knowing in respect of everything.",
767,"Be sure that Allah is severe in punishment and that Allah is Very-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
768,The duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the Message. Allah knows what you disclose and what you conceal.,
769,"Say, “The evil and the good are not equal, even though the abundance of (what is) evil may attract you. So, fear Allah, O people of understanding, so that you may be successful.”",
770,"O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if disclosed, would displease you. If you ask about them while the Qur’ān is being revealed, they will be disclosed to you. Allah has pardoned you for it. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Forbearing.",
771,"People before you asked such questions, and then, as a result, became disbelievers.",
772,"Allah has made no BaHīrah, no Sā’ibah, no WaSīlah and no Hāmī (names of animals dedicated to idols on different grounds). But those who disbelieve coin a lie against Allah, and most of them do not understand.",
773,"When it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger;” they say, “Sufficient for us is that on which we have found our forefathers.” Is it so, even though their forefathers knew nothing, and had no guidance either?",
774,"O you who believe, take care of your own selves. The one who has gone astray cannot harm you, if you are on the right path. To Allah all of you have to return. Then He will tell you what you have been doing.",
775,"O you who believe, when death draws near one of you, that is, at the time of making a will, the evidence (recognized) between you shall be of two witnesses from among you, or of two others not from you, if you are travelling on the earth and the trauma of death visits you. (Then) you shall detain them after the prayer, if you have some doubt, and they shall swear by Allah, “We shall not take a price for it, even if there be a relative; and we shall not conceal the evidence (as due) of Allah, otherwise we should certainly be among the sinners.”",
776,"Then, if it is discovered that the two had rendered themselves liable to a sin, then, in their place shall stand two others, closest of those whose right has been taken away, and they shall swear by Allah, “Our evidence is more truthful than their evidence, and we have not transgressed; otherwise we should be among the unjust.”",
777,"Thus, it is more likely that the former people (i.e. the executors of the bequest) will bear witness in its proper way, or they will fear that oaths will be taken in rebuttal of their oaths. Fear Allah and listen. Allah does not lead sinning people to the right path.",
778,"(Be mindful of) the day when Allah will assemble the messengers and will say to them, “How were you responded to?” They will say, “We have no knowledge. Surely You alone have the full knowledge of all that is unseen.”",
779,"(Call to mind the time) when Allah will say, “O ‘Īsā, son of Maryam, remember My blessing upon you and upon your mother; when I supported you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to people while you were still in the cradle and when you grew to middle age. I taught you the Book and the Wisdom, the Torah and the Injīl. You created from clay something in the shape of a bird, then you blew on it, and it became a bird by My leave. You cured those born blind and lepers by My leave.You raised the dead by My leave. I kept the children of Isrā’īl away from you when you came to them with clear signs, and the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but a clear magic.”",
780,"When I enjoined upon the disciples (of ‘Īsā ), “Believe in Me and in My Messenger,” they said, “We believed. Bear witness that we are the submitting ones.”",
781,"When the disciples said, “O ‘Īsā, son of Maryam, can your Lord send down to us a repast from the heavens?” He said, “Fear Allah if you are believers.”",
782,"They said, “We wish that we eat from it, and our hearts be satisfied, and we may know for sure that you have told us the truth, and we may become witnesses to it.”",
783,"‘Īsā son of Maryam said, “O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a repast from heaven which may be a happy occasion for us, for all our generations present and future, and a sign from You, and give us provisions. You are the best Giver of Provisions.”",
784,"Allah said, “I am going to send it down to you; but whoever among you disbelieves after that, I shall give him such a punishment as I shall not give to anyone else in all the worlds.”",
785,"And when Allah said, “O ‘Īsā, son of Maryam, did you say to the people: ‘Take me and my mother as gods beside Allah?” He said, “Pure are You, it does not behoove me to say what is not right for me. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my heart, and I do not know what is in Your’s. You alone have full knowledge of all that is unseen.",
786,"I have not said to them anything but what You have ordered me to say, that is, ‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord’ and I was a witness over them as long as I was with them. But when You recalled me, You were the One watching over them. You are a witness over everything.",
787,"If You punish them, they are Your slaves after all, but if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.”",
788,"Allah will say, “This is a day on which the truth of the truthful shall benefit them. For them there are gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will live forever. Allah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. That is the great achievement.",

790,"All praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and the earth, and made darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve equate (others) with their Lord.",
791,"He is the One who created you from clay, then destined a term. The fixed term lies with Him, yet you are in doubt.",
792,"He is the true God in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.",
793,"Yet whenever a sign from the signs of their Lord comes to them, they do nothing but turn away from it.",
794,So they rejected the truth when it came to them.Now there shall come to them a full account of what they used to ridicule.,
795,"Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed prior to them-those whom We had given such a strong position in the land as We did not give to you, and We poured on them abundant rains from the sky, and made rivers flow beneath them? Then We destroyed them because of their sins, and raised up another generation after them.",
796,"If We had sent down to you something written on paper, and they had even touched it with their hands, still the disbelievers would have said, “This is nothing but obvious magic.”",
797,"They say, “Why is it that an angel has not been sent down to him?” Had We sent down an angel, the whole matter would have been closed, and thereafter no further time would have been allowed to them.",
798,"If We had made him an angel, We would have obviously made him a man, and would have caused them the same confusion they are causing now.",
799,"Even before you (O Prophet,) many messengers were ridiculed. Those who laughed at them were, then, besieged by what they used to ridicule.",
800,"Say, “Go about the earth, and see what was the fate of those who rejected (the prophets).”",
801,"Say, “To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has prescribed Mercy for Himself. He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt.Those who have brought loss to themselves are not going to believe.",
802,"To Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day. He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
803,"Say, “Would I take as guardian someone other than Allah Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and Who feeds others, and is not fed by anyone?” Say, “I have been asked to be the first to submit (to Him) and never to be one of those who ascribe partners to Allah.”",
804,"Say, “If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a momentous day.”",
805,"Whoever is spared from it (the punishment of that day) is, indeed, blessed with His mercy. That is the manifest achievement.",
806,"If Allah causes you harm, there is no one to remove it except He Himself; and if He causes you good, then He is powerful over everything.",
807,"He is Dominant over His servants, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.",
808,"Say, “Whose testimony is the greatest?” Say, “Allah is the witness between me and you, and this Qur’ān has been revealed to me so that I should thereby warn you, and whomsoever it may reach. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods along with Allah?” Say, “I bear no such witness.” Say, “In fact, He is one God. I disown what you associate (with Him).”",
809,"Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him (the Messenger) as (certainly as) they would recognize their sons. Those who have brought loss to themselves, they are not going to believe.",
810,"Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His signs? Beware, the unjust shall not prosper.",
811,"(Be mindful of) the Day We shall gather them together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, “Where are those you claimed to be partners of Allah?”",
812,"Then, they will have no other mischievous move but that they will say, “By Allah, our Lord, we ascribed no partners to Allah.”",
813,"See how they will lie about themselves, and all that they used to forge will vanish from them.",
814,"There are those among them who (apparently) listen to you, but We have put coverings on their hearts, so that they do not understand, and heaviness in their ears. If they were to see all the signs, they would still not believe in them, so much so that, when they come to quarrel with you, the disbelievers say (of the Qur’ān), “It is nothing but tales of the ancients.”",
815,"From it (the Qur’ān) they prevent others, and from it they keep themselves away. They ruin none but their own selves, while they do not realize it.",
816,"If only you could (be there to) see when they will be made to stand by the Fire, and they will say, “Would that we were sent back, then we would not reject the signs of our Lord, and would join the believers.”",
817,"In fact, what they were concealing earlier will become clear to them. If they were sent back, they would again go for what they were forbidden from, as they are sheer liars.",

819,"If only you could see when they will be made to stand before their Lord! He will say, “Is this not true?” They will say, “Of course, by our Lord, it is.” He will say, “Then, taste the punishment, for you used to disbelieve.”",
820,"Losers indeed are those who deny that they will ever face Allah, until when the Hour will come upon them suddenly, they will say, “Alas! We have been negligent about it.” They shall carry their burdens on their backs. Beware! Evil is the burden they carry.",
821,"The worldly life is nothing but a game and fun, and the last abode is surely much better for those who fear Allah. Would you still not understand?",
822,"Indeed We know that what they say makes you sad, because it is not you whom they reject, but the transgressors actually deny the signs of Allah.",
823,"Indeed, many messengers have been rejected before you, but they stood patient against their rejection, and they were persecuted until Our help came to them. No one can change the words of Allah, and of course, some accounts of the messengers have already come to you.",
824,"If their aversion is too hard on you, then seek, if you can, a tunnel into the earth or a ladder unto the sky in order to bring them a sign. Had Allah so willed, He would have brought all of them to the right path. So, never be one of the ignorant.",
825,"Only those respond who listen (to seek the truth). As for the dead, Allah shall raise them, after which they shall be returned to Him.",
826,"They say, “Why is it that no sign (of our choice) has been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “Allah is surely powerful enough to send down a sign.” But most of them do not know.",
827,"There is no creature moving on the earth, nor a bird flying on its two wings, but they are all communities like you. We have not missed anything in the Book. Then, to their Lord all of them shall be gathered.",
828,"Those who gave the lie to Our signs are deaf and dumb, in layers of darkness. He lets whomsoever He wills go astray, and brings whomsoever He wills on the straight path.",

Preach with it (the Qur’ān), lest one should be seized for what he did, in a way that he should have neither a helper besides Allah, nor an intercessor.

935,"For those who are Jews We prohibited all that has claws. Of cows and goats, We prohibited for them their fats, except that which is borne by their backs or the entrails, or what is attached to a bone. Thus We recompensed them for their transgression. We are definitely truthful.",

1429,"(O Prophet,) what they say should not make you grieve. Surely, all power belongs to Allah. He is All-Hearing, All Knowing.",
1430,"Listen, to Allah belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth. And those who invoke associate-gods besides Allah do not follow a reality. They follow nothing but whims and do nothing but make conjectures.",
1431,"He is the One who made for you the night, so that you may have rest in it, and (made) the day to see. Indeed, there are signs therein for a people who listen.",
1432,"They say, “Allah has got a son.” Pure is He. He is Self-Sufficient. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. You have no proof for it. Do you allege about Allah what you do not know?",
1433,Say: Those who fabricate lies against Allah shall not prosper.,
1434,"It will be a little enjoyment in this world; thereafter to Us they are bound to return; then We shall make them taste the severe punishment, because they used to disbelieve.",
1435,"Recite to them the story of (the Prophet) NūH (Noah), when he said to his people, “O my people, if it is hard on you that I stay (with you) and give (you) advice through the signs of Allah, then, in Allah I place my trust. So, be firm in your plan (against me) with (the help of) all your partners, and your plan should not be a cause of concern for you; then carry it out against me and give me no respite.",
1436,"Still, if you turn away, then, I did not demand any reward from you. My reward is with none except Allah, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit.”",
1437,"Then they rejected him, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them the successors, and drowned those who gave the lie to Our signs. So look how was the fate of those who were warned.",
1438,"Then, after him, We sent messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear signs, but they were not to believe in what they had rejected earlier. This is how We seal the hearts of the transgressors.",
1439,"Then, after them, We sent Mūsā and Hārūn with Our signs to Pharaoh and his group, but they showed arrogance. And they were surely a guilty people.",
1440,"So, when Truth came to them from Us, they said, “It is certainly a clear magic.”",
1441,"Mūsā said, “Do you say (this) about the Truth when it came to you? Is this magic, while the magicians do not achieve success?”",
1442,"They said, “Have you come to us to turn us away from the way on which we have found our fathers, and so that you both have supremacy on earth? We are not going to believe in you.”",
1443,"And Pharaoh said, “Bring to me every knowledgeable magician.”",
1444,"So, when the magicians came, Mūsā said to them, “Cast what you have to cast.”",
1445,"So, when they had cast, Mūsā said, “All that you have brought is magic. Allah will certainly bring it to naught. Be assured that Allah does not set right the work of the mischief-makers.”",
1446,"And Allah establishes the truth through His words, even though the guilty ones may dislike it.",
1447,"Then, except some youths of his people, no one believed in Mūsā for the fear of Pharaoh and his group, lest he should persecute them. Pharaoh was high-handed in the land and he was of those who crossed all limits.",
1448,"And Mūsā said, “My people, if you have believed in Allah, then, in Him place your trust if you are obedient.”",
1449,"So, they said, “In Allah we have placed our trust: Our Lord, do not make us a victim of the unjust people,",
1450,"and save us, through Your mercy, from the disbelieving people.”",
1451,"And We revealed to Mūsā and his brother: “Have houses for your people in Egypt, and make your houses worship oriented, and establish Salāh, and give good tidings to the believers.”",
1452,"Mūsā said, “Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his group glamour and riches in the worldly life, so that, our Lord, they mislead (people) from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their riches and harden their hearts, so that they may not come to believe until they witness the painful punishment.”",
1453,"Allah said, “The prayer of the two of you has been granted; so stand firm, and never follow the way of the ignorant.”",
1454,"And We let the children of Isrā’īl cross the sea. So, Pharaoh and his troops chased them in transgression and hostility, until when he was about to drown, he said, “I believe that there is no god but the One in whom the children of Isrā’īl believe, and I am among those who submit to Allah.”",
1455,"(Allah said,) “Is it now (that you have come to believe) while you were rebellious all along, and you were among the mischief-makers?",
1456,"So, today, We shall save your body, so that you may become a sign for those after you. And many of the people are heedless of Our signs.”",
1457,"And surely We gave the children of Isrā’īl a proper place to live, and provided them with good things. Then they did not disagree between themselves but after knowledge had come to them. Surely, Allah will decide between them on the Day of Judgment about the matters in which they used to dispute each other.",
1458,"So, (O prophet,) even if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to you, ask those who read the Book (revealed) before you. Surely, truth has come to you from your Lord, so never be among those who are suspicious.",
1459,"And never be among those who have rejected Our signs, lest you should be among the losers.",
1460,"Surely, those against whom the Word of your Lord stands settled will not believe,",
1461,"even though every sign comes to them, unless they witness the painful punishment.",
1462,"So, how is it that there never was a town, which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yūnus? When they came to believe, We removed from them the punishment of humiliation in the worldly life and let them enjoy themselves for some time.",
1463,"Had your Lord willed, all those on earth would have believed altogether. Would you, then, compel people, so that they become believers?",
1464,It is not (possible) for any one that he believes except with the will of Allah. And He makes filth settle on those who do not understand.,
1465,"Say, “Look at what is there in the heavens and the earth.” But, signs and warnings do not suffice a people who do not believe.",
1466,"So, are they waiting for nothing short of something like the days of those who have passed before them? Say, “So wait. I am with you, among those who are waiting.”",
1467,"Then We (used to) save Our messengers and those who believed. Similarly, it being undertaken by Us, We shall save the believers.",
1468,"Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about my Faith, then, I do not worship those whom you worship beside Allah. Rather, I worship Allah who brings death to you. And I have been ordained to be among the believers,",
1469,"and that I should make myself firm on Faith, being upright, and never should be among the Mushriks (who ascribe partners to Allah).”",
1470,"And do not invoke, other than Allah, what neither benefits you nor harms you, for, if you do so, then you will surely be one of the unjust.",
1471,"If Allah brings some harm to you, there is none to remove it except He. And if He intends to bring some good to you, there is none to turn His grace back. He brings it to whomever He wills from among His servants. He is the Most-Forgiving, the Very Merciful.",
1472,"Say, “O people, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So, whoever accepts guidance accepts it to his own benefit, and whoever goes astray does so to his own detriment. And I am not responsible for you.”",
1473,"Follow what is being revealed to you, and be patient until Allah gives His judgment, and He is the best of all judges.",
1474,"Alif , Lām , Rā . (This is) a book the verses of which have been made firm, and elaborated by the One who is All Wise, All Aware,",
1475,"(directing the Prophet to say to the people,) “You must not worship anyone other than Allah; I am for you a warner from Him, and a bearer of glad tidings;",
1476,"and you must seek forgiveness from your Lord, then, turn to Him in repentance, and He will provide you with good things to enjoy for a given time, and bestow His extra favor on everyone who has extra good deeds (in his account). And if you turn away, then, I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day.",
1477,"To Allah is your return, and He is powerful over everything.”",
1478,"Beware, they bend their chests to hide from Him. Beware, when they cover up themselves with their clothes, He knows what they hide and what they expose. Surely, He is All Aware of what lies in the hearts.",
1479,There is no creature on earth whose sustenance is not undertaken by Allah. He knows its permanent and its temporary place. Everything is in a clear book.,
1480,"He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, while His throne was on water, so that He might test you as to who among you is better in deed. And if you say, “You shall be raised after death,” the disbelievers will surely say, “This is nothing but sheer magic.”",
1481,"And if We defer the punishment for them for a certain time, they will say, “What is holding it back?” Beware, the day it will visit them, it shall not be turned back from them, and they shall be besieged by what they used to ridicule.",
1482,"If We give man a taste of Our mercy and then take it away from him, he becomes highly desperate, utterly ungrateful.",
1483,"And if We give him a taste of comfort after a hardship has touched him, he will say, “Evils have gone away from me”, (and thus) He will become over-exulting, boastful,",
1484,except those who are patient and do good deeds. Such people will have Allah’s forgiveness and a great reward.,
1485,"Is it then possible from you (O Prophet,) that you will abandon some of what is being revealed to you, and that your heart will be straitened thereby, because they say, “Why has a treasure not been sent down to him or an angel not come with him?” You are but a warner. And Allah takes care of everything.",
1486,"Do they say that he has fabricated it? Say (to them), “Then bring ten Sūrahs like this, fabricated. And call whomsoever you can, other than Allah, if you are true.”",
1487,"So, if they do not respond to your call, then be assured that it has been sent down with the knowledge of Allah and that there is no god but He. So, do you submit?",
1488,"Those who seek (merely) the worldly life and its beauty, We will fully recompense them herein for their acts, and their right will not be curtailed in this world.",
1489,"Those are the people for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter except fire. Nullified will be whatever they worked herein, and void will be what they have been doing.",
1490,"Then, can such people be equal to the one who has a clear proof from his Lord, followed by an evidence from within, and before which there was the Book of Mūsā, a guide and a mercy? Such people believe in it; and whoever of the groups denies its veracity, his promised place is the Fire. So, do not be in doubt about it. Surely, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of people do not believe.",
1491,"Who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah? Such people will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord. Lo! the curse of Allah lies on the unjust,",
1492,"the ones who prevent (people) from the way of Allah and seek crookedness in it, and who are deniers of the Hereafter.”",
1493,"They were unable to frustrate (Allah’s plan) on the earth, and they had no supporters besides Allah. Punishment will be doubled for them. They were not able to hear, nor would they see.",
1494,"Those are the ones who brought loss to their own selves, and all that they used to fabricate vanished from them.",
1495,"Essentially, they are the worst losers in the Hereafter.",
1496,"Surely, those who believe and do good deeds and humble themselves before their Lord, those are the people of Paradise. There they shall live forever.",
1497,"The example of the two groups is that of a blind and deaf person on the one hand, and a seeing and hearing one on the other. Are the two equal when compared? Would you still pay no heed?",
1498,We sent NūH to his people (saying to them): “I am here to warn you,
1499,"that you should worship none but Allah, (otherwise) I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.”",
1500,"So the chiefs of his people who disbelieved replied, “We are not seeing that you are anything more than a man like us, and we are not seeing that any people have followed you except those who are the meanest among us, and we have not seen in you people any superiority over us; rather, we believe that you are liars.”",
1501,"He said, “O my people, tell me, if I am on a clear path from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself which is hidden from your sight, shall we, then, impose it upon you by force, while you are averse to it?",
1502,"And, O my people, I do not demand from you any wealth for it. My reward is with none but Allah. And I am not the one who could drive the believers away. Surely, they will be meeting their Lord (gracefully), but I do see your behavior is that of ignorance.",
1503,"O my people, who would help me against (the punishment of) Allah, if I were to drive them away? Would you still take no lesson?",
1504,"And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah, nor that I have the knowledge of the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say (as you do) about those who are contemptible in your eyes that Allah will never award them any good; Allah knows best what lies in their hearts. (If I were to say so,) then, I would indeed be one of the unjust.”",
1505,"They said, “O NūH, you have debated with us, and debated too much. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are one of the truthful.”",
1506,"He said, “Only Allah will bring it to you, if He so wills, and you cannot frustrate (His will).",
1507,"My good counsel will not profit you, even though I wish you the best, if Allah wills to let you go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you shall be made to return.”",
1508,"Do they (the pagans of Makkah) still say that he (Muhammad) has forged it? Say, “If I have forged it, then, I am responsible for my sin, and I am free of the sins you commit.”",
1509,"And it was revealed to NūH: None of your people would come to believe any more, except those who have already believed. So, be not distressed by what they have been doing.",
1510,"And make an ark under Our eyes and according to Our revelation; and do not speak to Me about those who have crossed the limits, as they are destined to be drowned.”",
1511,"He started making the Ark. Whenever the leaders of his people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said, “If you mock at us, we mock at you like you mock at us:",
1512,"So, you shall soon know who will be visited by a scourge that will humiliate him, and upon whom a lasting punishment will settle forever.”",
1513,"At last, when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, “Take into the Ark a pair of two from every species, along with your family,-except those against whom the Word has already been pronounced-and (also take into it) those who have believed.” And there were only a few who had believed with him.",
1514,"He (NūH) said, “Embark it. With the name of Allah it sails and anchors. Surely, my Lord is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
1515,"And it was sailing with them amidst the waves like mountains. And NūH called out to his son, who was at an isolated place, “O my child, come on board with us, and do not be in the company of the disbelievers.”",
1516,"He said, “I shall take shelter on a mountain which will save me from the water.” He said, “There is no saver today from the command of Allah, except the one to whom He shows mercy.” And the waves rose high between the two, and he was among those who were drowned.",
1517,"It was said (by Allah), “O earth, suck in your water, and O heaven, stop.” And water subsided, and the matter was over. It (the Ark) came to rest on the Jūdī, and it was said, “Away with the wrongdoers.”",
1518,"NūH called unto his Lord and said, “My Lord, my son is a part of my family, and surely Your promise is true, and You are the greatest of all judges.”",
1519,"He said, “O NūH, in fact, he is not a part of your family. Indeed, he is (a man of) bad deeds. So do not ask Me something of which you have no knowledge. I exhort you not to be among the ignorant.”",
1520,"He said, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You that I should ask You something of which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive me and do not show mercy to me, I shall be among the losers.”",
1521,"It was said, “O NūH, disembark in peace from Us and with blessings upon you and upon the peoples (springing) from those with you. And there are peoples whom We shall give some enjoyment, then a painful punishment from Us will visit them.”",
1522,"These are some reports from the unseen (events), which We reveal to you. You did not know them before this, neither you nor your people. So, be patient. Surely, the end is in favor of the God-fearing.",
1523,"And to ‘Ād, (We sent) their brother Hūd. He said, “O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. You are nothing but fabricators.",
1524,"O my people, I ask you no reward for it. My reward is only on the One who created me. Do you, then, not understand?",
1525,"O my people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn to Him in repentance, and He will release the heavens pouring upon you, and will add strength to your strength, and do not turn away like sinners.”",
1526,"They said, “O Hūd, you did not bring to us any proof, and we are not to leave our gods on your statement, and we are not to believe in you.",
1527,"We do not say except that some of our gods have subjected you to some evil.” He said, “I make Allah my witness, and you bear witness that I have nothing to do with what you take as gods",
1528,"besides Him. So, try your plans against me, all of you together, then give me no respite.",
1529,"I place my trust in Allah who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but He holds it by the forelock. Surely, my Lord is on a straight path.",
1530,"Now, if you turn away, I have already conveyed to you the message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will replace you with some other people, and you cannot do Him any harm. Surely, my Lord is guardian over every thing.”",
1531,"So, when came Our command, We saved Hūd and those who believed along with him, out of mercy from Us, and We did save them from a heavy punishment.",
1532,"Such was the tribe of ‘Ād who rejected the signs of their Lord, disobeyed their Messengers and followed the dictates of every obstinate tyrant!",
1533,"A curse was made to pursue them in this world and on the Day of Judgment. Lo! The people of ‘Ād disbelieved their Lord. Lo! Ruined were ‘Ād, the people of Hūd.",
1534,"And to (the people of) Thamūd (We sent) their brother, SāliH. He said, “O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. He has created you from earth and made you settle therein. So, seek His forgiveness, then turn to Him in repentance. Surely, my Lord is near, responsive to the prayers.”",
1535,"They said, “O SāliH, we had hopes in you before this. Do you ask us not to worship what our fathers used to worship? We have serious doubts that have disturbed us about the faith to which you are calling us.”",
1536,"He said, “O my people, tell me: If I have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, who will come to my help against Allah, if I still disobey Him? So, you extend nothing to me but loss.",
1537,"And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah, a sign for you. So, leave her free to eat on the earth of Allah, and do not even touch her with evil (intention), lest an approaching punishment should seize you.”",
1538,"Then they slaughtered her. So, he said, “Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days (only). That is a promise, not to be backed out.”",
1539,"So, when came Our command, We saved SāliH and those who believed along with Him, out of mercy from Us, and (We saved them) from the disgrace of that day. Surely, your Lord is the Powerful, the All Mighty.",
1540,"And those who transgressed were caught by the Cry, and they were found dead in their homes, fallen on their knees,",
1541,as though they had never lived there. Lo! The people of Thamūd disbelieved their Lord. Lo! Ruined were the people of Thamūd.,
1542,"And Our emissaries came to Ibrāhīm with the good news. They greeted him with “Salām (peace).” He said, “Salām.” Then he took not much time in bringing a roasted calf.",
1543,"So, when he noticed their hands not acceding to it, he found them strange and felt scared of them. They said, “Be not scared. We have been sent to the people of LūT.”",
1544,"His wife was standing (nearby), and she laughed. Thus We gave her the good news about IsHāq, and about Ya‘qūb after IsHāq.",
1545,"She said, “Woe to me! Shall I give birth to a child while I am an old woman and this is my husband, an old man? This is something amazing indeed.”",
1546,"They said, “Do you marvel at Allah’s command? Allah’s mercy and His blessings have always been upon you, O people of the house. Surely, He is Praiseworthy, Glorious.”",
1547,"So, when fear left Ibrāhīm and the happy news came to him, he started disputing with Us for the people of LūT.",
1548,"Surely, Ibrāhīm is forbearing, very penitent, ever-turning to Allah.",
1549,"“O Ibrāhīm! Leave it. In fact, the command of your Lord has come to pass, and there has to come upon them a punishment that cannot be averted.”",
1550,"When Our emissaries (angels) came to LūT, he was saddened because of them, and his heart felt uneasy for their sake, and He said, “This is a very hard day.”",
1551,"And his people came to him, rushing upon him. They were already habitual to commit evil deeds. He said, “These are my daughters. They are purer for you.So, have fear of Allah and do not disgrace me in respect of my guests. Is there no reasonable man among you?”",
1552,"They said, “You know that we have no claim on your daughters, and you know well what we want.”",
1553,"He said, “Would that I had some power over you, or could seek refuge in a strong support!”",
1554,"They (the angels) said, “O LūT, we are emissaries of your Lord. They shall never reach you. So, move with your family in a part of night, and none of you shall turn to look back; except your woman. There has to befall her whatever will befall them. Their deadline is the morning. Is it not that the morning is near?”",
1555,"So, when Our command came to pass, We turned their habitations upside down, and rained on it stones of hard clay, one over another",
1556,marked from your Lord. And it is not far from the transgressors.,
1557,"And to Madyan (We sent) their brother, Shu‘aib. He said, “O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And do not curtail the measure and the weight. I see you quite well off, and I fear for you the punishment of an encircling day.",
1558,"And O my people, perfect the measure and the balance with justice and do not make the people short of their things, and do not go about the earth spreading disorder.",
1559,"Whatever is allowed by Allah to retain (lawfully) is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a watchman over you.",
1560,"They said, “O Shu‘aib, does your Salāh (prayer) command you that we should forsake what our fathers used to worship or that we should not deal with our wealth as we please? You pretend to be the only man of wisdom and guidance.”",
1561,"He said, “O my people, tell me, if I am on a clear path from my Lord and He has provided me with a good provision from Himself, (should I still leave you unguided?) I do not want to do in your absence what I forbid you from. I want nothing but to set things right as far as I can. My ability to do any thing comes from none but Allah. In Him alone I have placed my trust and to Him alone I turn in humbleness.",
1562,"O my people, let not your hostility towards me cause you to suffer what was suffered by the people of NūH, or the people of Hūd, or the people of SāliH. And the people of LūT are not far from you.",
1563,"Seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn towards Him in repentance. Surely, my Lord is very merciful, most loving.”",
1564,"They said, “O Shu‘aib, we do not understand much of what you say, and, in fact, we see you are weak among us. But for your clan, we would have stoned you. And to us, you are not a man of respect.”",
1565,"He said, “O my people, is my clan more respectable to you than Allah, as you have taken Him as something thrown behind your backs? Surely, my Lord encompasses all that you do.",
1566,"O my people, do what you can, I am to do (what I can). Soon you will know the one whom the punishment will visit, putting him to disgrace, and the one who is false. And wait. I am, with you, waiting.”",
1567,"And when Our command came, We saved Shu‘aib and those who believed along with him, out of mercy from Us; and those who transgressed were caught by the Cry, and they were found (dead) in their homes, fallen on their knees",
1568,"as though they never lived there. Lo! Ruined were Madyan, like Thamūd were ruined.",
1569,"And We sent Mūsā, with Our signs and with clear proof,",
1570,"to Pharaoh and his group. So, they followed the command of Pharaoh, while the command of Pharaoh was not right.",
1571,"He will lead his people on the Day of Judgement, and make them descend into the Fire. And it is the evil descending place.",
1572,The curse was made to pursue them here and on the Day of Judgement. It is the evil reward to be offered.,
1573,"That is a part of stories of the towns that We narrate to you. Some of them are still standing, and (some are) eradicated like a harvested field.",
1574,"We did no wrong to them; rather, they have wronged themselves. So, their gods whom they used to invoke beside Allah did not come to their help in any way, when came the command of your Lord, and they added nothing to them except destruction.",
1575,"Such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the (people of) towns when they are transgressing. Indeed, His seizing is painful, severe.",
1576,"In this there is a sign for the one who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day when all the people shall be gathered together, and that is a day which will be witnessed by all.",
1577,We do not defer it but for a limited term.,
1578,"The day it comes no one shall speak except by His leave. So, some of them will be wretched and (some) blessed.",
1579,"As for those who are wretched, they shall be in the Fire. For them there is (nothing but) crying and howling.",
1580,"They shall remain there forever, as long as the heavens and the earth remain intact, unless your Lord wills (otherwise). Surely, your Lord does what He intends.",
1581,"As for those who are blessed, they shall be in Paradise living there forever, as long as the heavens and the earth remain intact, unless your Lord wills (otherwise), It will be an award never to be ceased.",
1582,"So, be not in doubt about what they worship. They worship only in the way their fathers used to worship earlier. Surely, We are going to pay them their full share, not curtailed in the least.",
1583,"And We gave Mūsā the Book, then it was disputed about. But for a word from your Lord that had already come to pass, the matter would have been decided between them. Surely, they are in confounding doubt about it.",
1584,"And to all of them, your Lord shall pay for their deeds in full. Surely, He is aware of all that they do.",
1585,"So, stand firm (on faith) as you have been commanded, as well as those who having repented (from disbelief) have joined you, and do not cross the limits. Surely, He is watchful of what you do.",
1586,"And do not incline towards the wrongdoers, lest the Fire should catch you, and you have no supporters other than Allah, then you should not be helped.",
1587,"Establish Salāh at both ends of the day, and in the early hours of the night. Surely, good deeds erase bad deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.",
1588,"And be patient, for Allah does not let the reward of the righteous go to waste.",
1589,"Then, why is it that there were no people, among the generations before you, who would have enough remnants of wisdom to stop others from creating disorder in the land, except a few among them whom We saved (from Our punishment)? And the wrongdoers pursued the luxuries they were involved in, and they became sinners.",
1590,Your Lord is not such that He would destroy the towns unjustly while their people are good in their ways.,
1591,"Had your Lord willed, He would have made all the people a single community. But, they will continue in their differences,",
1592,"except those whom Allah has blessed with mercy, and for that He has created them. And perfect is the word of your Lord: “I will surely fill the Hell with Jinns and the human beings, all together.”",
1593,"We narrate to you all such stories from the events of the messengers as We strengthen your heart therewith. And in these (stories) there has come to you the truth, a good counsel and a reminder to those who believe.",

1606,"One of them said, “Do not kill Yūsuf; rather, cast him into the bottom of a pit, so that some wayfarers may pick him up, if you are going to do something anyway.’’",
1607,"They said (to Ya‘qūb), “Our father, why is it that you do not trust us about Yūsuf, while we are his well-wishers indeed.",

1611,"So, when they went away with him and were determined to put him in the bottom of a pit, (they did accordingly). And We revealed to him (Yūsuf), “You will (one day) remind them of this deed of theirs, and they will not recognize (you).”",
1612,"And at nightfall, they came to their father weeping.",
1613,"They said, “Father, we went racing with one another, and left Yūsuf with our belongings, and the wolf ate him up. You will never believe us, howsoever truthful we may be.”",
1614,"And they came with fake blood on his shirt. He said, “Rather, your inner desires have tempted you to do something. So, patience is best. It is Allah whose help is sought against what you describe.’’",
1615,"And some wayfarers came (near the pit in which Yūsuf was thrown), and sent their water-drawer (to bring water for them). So, he let down his bucket. He said, “What a good news! Here is a boy.” And they kept him hidden as merchandise, while Allah was aware of what they were doing.",

1617,"And the one who bought him from Egypt said to his wife, “Make his stay graceful. He may be useful for us. Or, we may adopt him as a son.” And thus We established Yūsuf in the land, so that We should teach him the interpretation of events.

1618,"And when he reached the prime of his age, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and this is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.",
1619,"And she, in whose house he was, seduced him towards herself, and bolted the doors, and said, “come on!” He said, “I seek refuge with Allah. Surely, he (your husband) is my master. He has given me a good lodging. Indeed, the wrongdoers do not prosper.”",

1622,"He (Yūsuf) said, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” And a witness from her family observed that if his shirt was ripped from the front side, then she is true and he is a liar;",
1623,"and if his shirt was ripped from behind, then she is telling a lie and he is truthful.",
1624,"So, when he (her husband) saw his shirt ripped from behind, he said, “This is certainly your trickery, O women. Great is the trickery of you women indeed.",

1627,"So, when she heard of their taunting comments, she extended an invitation to them and arranged for them a comfortable place (to sit and dine) and gave everyone a knife, and said (to Yūsuf): “come out to them.” So when they saw him, they found him great, and (were so stunned that they) cut their hands and said, “Oh God! He is no human being. He is but a noble angel.”",
1628,"She said, “This is the one about whom you reproached me. Yes, I seduced him, but he abstained. And should he not follow my command, he shall be imprisoned and will be disgraced.”",
1629,"He (Yūsuf) said, “My Lord, the prison is dearer to me than what these women invite me to do. If You do not turn their guile away from me, I shall get inclined towards them and shall be among the ignorant.”",

1633,"He said, “No food provided for you shall come to you, but I can give you its description before it comes to you. This is the knowledge my Lord has given to me. I have abandoned the way of those who do not believe in Allah, and who are deniers of the Hereafter,",

1637,"“O my fellow prisoners, one of you will serve wine to his master, while the other will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. Destined is the matter you are asking about.”",
1638,"And he (Yūsuf) said to the one whom he believed likely to be released out of the two, “Tell your master about me.” Then, the Satan made him forget to tell his master. So, he (Yūsuf) remained in prison for a few years.",
1639,"And (one day) the king said (to his courtiers), “I have seen (in a dream) seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and seven ears of grain which are green and (seven) others which are dry. O people, tell me about my dream, if you can interpret dreams.”",
1640,"They said, “(It seems to be) a mishmash of dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams.”",
1641,"And said the one who was released (from the prison) out of the two, and recalled (Yūsuf) after a long time, “I shall tell you its interpretation. Just send me (to Yūsuf).”",
1642,"(Thus he came to the prison and said to Yūsuf “Yūsuf, O the truthful one, tell us about seven fat cows eaten by seven lean ones, and seven ears of grain which are green and (seven) others which are dry, so that I may go back to the people and they may know (the interpretation of the dream.)”",
1643,"He said, “You will grow crops for seven years consecutively. So, what you have harvested, leave it in its ear, except a little which you eat.",

1645,Then there shall come after that a year in which people will have rains and in which they will extract juices.”,
1646,"And (when this person went back and told the king about the interpretation of the dream), the king said, “Bring him to me.” So, when the messenger came to Yūsuf, he said, “Go back to your lord and ask him, ‘What is the case of the women who cut their hands?’ Surely, my Lord knows well their guile.”",
1647,"He (the king) said, “What was your case, O women, when you seduced Yūsuf?” They said, “God forbid, we know of no evil in him.” The governor’s wife said, “Now the truth has come to light. I did seduce him, and he is surely truthful.”",
1648,"(Then Yūsuf said), “That was because he (the governor) may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not lead the guile of betrayers to success.",
1649,"And I do not absolve my inner self of blame. Surely, man’s inner self often incites to evil, unless my Lord shows mercy. Certainly, my Lord is the Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.”",
1650,"The king said, “Bring him to me, and I shall employ him purely for myself.” So, when he (the king) talked to him, he said (to Yūsuf), “Today you are with us well-placed, fully trusted.”",
1651,"He said, “Appoint me to (supervise) the treasures of the land. I am indeed a knowledgeable keeper.”",
1652,"And thus We gave Yūsuf power in the land. He could settle in it wherever he wished. We extend Our mercy to whomsoever We will, and We do not let the reward of the righteous people to go to waste.",
1653,And the reward of the Hereafter is surely better for those who believe and constantly observe taqwā.,
1654,"And came the brothers of Yūsuf and appeared before him. He recognized them, while they did not recognize him.",
1655,"When he equipped them with their provisions, he said, “Bring to me your other brother from your father’s side. Do you not see that I give full measure, and I extend the best hospitality?",
1656,"Still, if you do not bring him to me, then you deserve no (further) measure from me, nor shall you approach me any more.”",
1657,"They said, “We shall persuade his father about him and we will certainly do it.”",
1658,"And he (Yūsuf) said to his boys, “Put their goods in their camel-packs. Perhaps they will recognize it when they go back to their family; perhaps they will come again.”",
1659,"So, when they returned to their father, they said, “Father, the (required) measure (of grain) has been withheld from us, therefore, send our brother with us, so that we may receive our full measure. And, of course, we are his guards.”",
1660,"He said, “Shall I trust you about him as I trusted you earlier about his brother? Well, Allah is the best guardian, and He is the Most-Merciful of all the merciful.”",
1661,"When they opened their baggage, they found their goods given back to them. They said, “Our father, what else should we want? Here is our goods given back to us, and we shall bring food to our family, protect our brother and add the measure of one camel more. That is an easy measure.”",
1662,"He said, “I shall never send him with you until you give me a pledge in the name of Allah that you will definitely bring him back to me, unless you are overpowered (by circumstances).” So, when they gave him their pledge, he said, “Allah is watchful over what we say.”",
1663,"And he said, “O my sons, do not enter (the city) all of you from the same gate, rather, enter from different gates. And I cannot help you in any way against (the will of) Allah. Sovereignty belongs to none but Allah. In Him I place my trust, and all those who trust should trust in Him alone.”",
1664,"And (recall) when they entered (the city) in the manner their father had advised them. He could not help them in any way against (the will of) Allah, but it was just an urge in the heart of Ya‘qūb which he satisfied; he was a man of knowledge, because We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.",
1665,"And when they came to Yūsuf, he lodged his brother (Binyamin) with himself. He said, “Look, I am your brother! So do not grieve for what they have been doing.”",
1666,"Later, when he equipped them with their provisions, he placed the bowl in the camel-pack of his brother. Then, an announcer shouted out, “O people of the caravan, you are thieves.”",
1667,"Turning towards them, they said, “What are you missing?”",
1668,"They said, “We are missing the measuring-bowl of the king, and whoever brings it back shall deserve a camel-load, and I stand surety for it.”",
1669,"They said, “We swear by Allah, you know, we did not come to make mischief in the land, nor have we ever been thieves.”",
1670,"They said, “What is the punishment, if you are liars?”",
1671,"They said, “Its punishment? The one in whose saddlebag it is found shall himself be the punishment. This is how we punish the wrongdoers.”",
1672,"So, he started with their bags before (searching) the bag of his brother, then, recovered it from the bag of his brother.This is how We planned for Yūsuf. He had no right to take his brother according to the law of the king, unless Allah so willed. We elevate in ranks whomsoever We will. Above every man of knowledge, there is someone more knowledgeable.",
1673,"They said, “If he commits theft, (there is nothing surprising, because) his other brother had committed theft earlier.” Yūsuf kept it (his reaction) to himself and did not reveal it to them. He said (in his heart), “You are even worse in position. Allah knows best of what you allege.”",
1674,"They said, “O ‘Azīz, he has a father, a very old man. So, take one of us in his place. We see you are a generous man.”",
1675,"He said, “We seek Allah’s refuge from keeping anyone other than him with whom we have found our thing, otherwise we shall be unjust.”",
1676,"So when they lost hope in him, they went aside for consultation. The oldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father has taken pledge from you in the name of Allah, while you had defaulted earlier in the case of Yūsuf. So, I shall never leave this land unless my father permits me or Allah decides about me. He is the best of all judges.",
1677,"Go back to your father and say, ‘Our father, your son has committed theft, and we do not testify except what we know, and we could not guard against the unseen.",
1678,"Ask (the people of) the town in which we have been, and the caravan with which we have come, and undoubtedly we are truthful.”",
1679,"He (Ya‘qūb) said, “Rather, your inner desires have seduced you to something. So, patience is best. Hopefully, Allah may bring them all together. Surely, He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”",
1680,"He turned away from them and said, “How sad I am about Yūsuf!” and his eyes turned white with sorrow and he was suppressing (his anger and grief).",
1681,"They said, “By God, you will not stop remembering Yūsuf until you collapse or perish.”",
1682,"He said, “I do not complain of my anguish and sorrow to anyone but Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.",
1683,"O my sons, go and search for Yūsuf and his brother, and do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah. In fact, only the infidels lose hope in Allah’s mercy.”",
1684,"So, when they came to him (Yūsuf), they said, “‘Azīz, we and our family are struck by distress, and we have brought some goods of very little worth. So, give us the full measure (of grain) and be charitable to us. Surely, Allah rewards the charitable.”",
1685,"He said, “Do you know what you did to Yūsuf and his brother when you were ignorant?”",
1686,"They said, “Is it that you are, in fact, Yūsuf?” He said, “I am Yūsuf, and this is my brother. Allah has been very kind to us. Surely, whoever fears Allah and observes patience, Allah does not let the reward of such good people to go to waste.”",
1687,"They said, “We swear by Allah, indeed Allah has given to you preference over us, and we were guilty in fact.”",
1688,"He said, “No reproach upon you today! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most- Merciful of all the merciful.",
1689,"Go with this shirt of mine, and put it over the face of my father, and he will turn into a sighted man. And bring to me all your family.”",
1690,"And when the caravan set out (from Egypt), their father (Ya‘qūb) said (in Canaan), “I sense the fragrance of Yūsuf, if you do not take me to be senile.”",
1691,"They said, “By God, you are still in your old fallacy!”",
1692,"So, when came the man with good news, he put it (the shirt) on his face, and he turned into a sighted man. He (Ya‘qūb) said, “Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?”",
1693,"They said, “Our father, pray to Allah to forgive us our sins. Surely, we have been guilty.”",
1694,"He said, “I shall pray to my Lord to forgive you. Surely, He is the Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.”",
1695,"Later, when they came to Yūsuf, he placed his parents near himself and said, “Enter Egypt, God willing, in peace.”",
1696,"And he raised his parents up on the throne, and they all fell before him in prostration. He said, “My father, here is the fulfillment of my early dream. My Lord has made it come true. He favored me when he released me from the prison, and brought you from the countryside after Satan had caused a rift between me and my brothers. Surely, my Lord does what He wills in a subtle way. Surely, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”",
1697,"“My Lord, You have given me power to rule and the knowledge of interpreting events. O Creator of the heavens and the Earth, You are my guardian in this world and the Hereafter. Make me die a Muslim and make me join the righteous.”",

1703,"Do they feel themselves secure from the visit of Allah’s encircling punishment or from the sudden arrival of the Hour, while they are not conscious of it?",
1704,"Say, “This is my way. I call (people) to Allah with full perception, both I and my followers. Pure is Allah; and I am not among those who associate partners with Allah.”",
1705,"We did not send before you (messengers) other than men from the people of the towns whom We inspired with revelation. Have they not traveled in the land where they could have seen how was the fate of those before them? And surely the abode of the Hereafter is much better for those who fear Allah. Would you, then, still not understand?",
1706,"(Punishment was often delayed) until when the messengers were in despair and thought that they were wrong in their estimation, Our help came to them, then saved were those whom We willed. And Our punishment is not averted from the guilty.",

1748,Have they not seen that We are coming to the land narrowing it down from all its sides? Allah judges; there is none to repel His judgement. And He is swift at reckoning.,
1749,"Those before them did devise plans, but all the real plans belong only to Allah. He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers will soon know for whom is the excellent end.",
1750,"The disbelievers say, “You are not a messenger.” Say, “Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you, and those too (are my witnesses) who have the knowledge of the Book.”",
1751,"Alif, Lām, Rā. This is a book We have sent down to you, so that you may deliver the people, with the will of their Lord, out of all sorts of darkness into the light, leading them to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy",
1752,"Allah, the One to whom belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Woe be to the disbelievers because of a severe punishment,",
1753,"to those who prefer the worldly life to the Hereafter and prevent (people) from the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked. Those have gone too far in straying.",
1754,"We did not send any messenger but (speaking) in the language of his people, so that he might clearly convey the message to them. So, Allah lets go astray whom He wills and lets find guidance whom He wills. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.",
1755,"Surely, We sent Mūsā with Our signs saying to him, “Bring your people out of (all sorts of) darkness into the light, and remind them of the Days of Allah. Surely, there are signs therein for every one who observes patience and gratitude.",
1756,"And when Mūsā said to his people, “Remember Allah’s blessing upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who had been inflicting a grievous torment on you, slaughtering your sons and leaving your women alive. In that there was a great trial from your Lord.”",
1757,"(Recall the time) when your Lord declared, “If you express gratitude, I shall certainly give you more, and if you are ungrateful, then My punishment is severe.”",
1758,"And Mūsā said, “If you and all those on earth become ungrateful, then Allah is free of all needs, worthy of every praise.”",
1759,"Has there not come to you the news of those before you, the people of NūH, ‘Ād and Thamūd and of those after them. No one knows them except Allah. Their prophets came to them with clear signs, but they put their hands into their mouths and said, “We reject what you are sent with, and indeed we are in confounding doubt about what you are calling us to believe.”",
1760,"Their prophets said, “Is it in Allah that you have some doubt, who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you, so that He may forgive you some of your sins and give you respite up to a specified term.” They said, “You are no more than a human being like us. You want to prevent us from what our forefathers used to worship. So, bring us some clear authority.”",
1761,"Their prophets said to them, “We are no more than a human being like you, but Allah bestows His favour upon whom He wills from among His servants. It is not for us to bring you an authority without Allah’s permission, and in Allah the believers must place their trust.",
1762,"What is wrong with us that we should not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us to our paths? We shall, of course, endure with patience all your persecutions; and all those who have to trust should trust only in Allah.”",
1763,"The disbelievers said to their prophets, “We shall certainly expel you from our land unless you come back to our faith.” So, their Lord revealed to them, “We shall destroy the transgressors,",
1764,and shall certainly let you dwell in the land after them. This is for the one who is fearful of standing before Me and is fearful of My warning.”,

1768,The deeds of those who refuse to believe in their Lord are like ashes blown away by the wind on a stormy day. They will not be able to gain anything out of what they did. That is the farthest point of straying away from the right path.,
1769,"Have you not seen that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He can put you away and bring a new creation;",
1770,and that is not at all difficult for Allah.,
1771,"All of them shall appear before Allah. Then, the weak shall say to the arrogant, “We were your followers. So, can you relieve us a little from Allah’s punishment?” They will say, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we deplore or endure, we have no way out.”",
1772,"The Satan will say when the matter will have been decided, “Allah promised you a truthful promise while I gave you a promise and did not fulfill it. I had no authority over you, except that I invited you and you accepted my call. So, do not blame me, but blame yourselves. Neither I can come to your help, nor can you come to my help. I disown your associating me with Allah in the past. Surely, there is a painful punishment for the unjust.”",
1773,"And those who believed and did good deeds shall be admitted to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, living there forever by the will of Allah. There they shall greet each other with “Salām.”",
1774,"Have you not seen how Allah has set forth a parable: A good word is like a good tree, having its root firm and its branches in the sky.",
1775,"It brings its fruits at all times with the will of its Lord. Allah sets forth the parables for the people, so that they may take lesson.",
1776,"And the parable of a bad word is like a bad tree, removed from the top of the soil, having no firm root.",
1777,Allah keeps the believers firm with the stable word in the worldly life and in the Hereafter; and Allah lets the unjust go astray; and Allah does what He wills.,
1778,"Have you not seen those who adopted disbelief in exchange of Allah’s favor and caused their people to disembark at a land of total destruction,",
1779,(which is) the Jahannam. They shall enter it; and it is an evil place to dwell.,
1780,"They have set up partners with Allah, so that they may mislead (the people) from His path. Say, “Enjoy (for a while). Then your ultimate journey is to the Fire.”",
1781,"Say to My believing servants that they should establish Salāh and spend, secretly and openly, out of what We have given to them before there comes a day in which there is neither a trade nor friendship.",
1782,"Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it sustenance for you from the produce, and subjugated for you the ships, so that they may sail in the sea with His command, and subjugated for you the rivers;",
1783,"and He subjugated for you the sun and the moon, moving constantly, and subjugated for you the day and the night,",
1784,"and He gave you whatever you asked for. If you (try to) count the bounties of Allah, you cannot count them all. Indeed, man is highly unjust, very ungrateful.",
1785,"(Recall) when Ibrāhīm said, “My Lord, make this city peaceful, and keep me and my children away from worshiping idols.",

1787,"Our Lord, I have settled some of my children in a valley of no vegetation, close to Your sanctified House, so that, Our Lord, they may establish Salāh. So, make hearts of people yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits, so that they may be grateful.",
1788,"Our Lord, surely You know what we conceal and what we reveal.-Hidden from Allah is nothing whatsoever, neither in the earth nor in the heavens.",
1789,"Praise be to Allah who, despite my old age, blessed me with Ismā‘īl (Ishmael) and IsHāq (Isaac). Surely, my Lord is the One who listens to the prayer.",

1791,"Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and all believers on the day when reckoning shall take place.”",
1792,Never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers are doing. He is but giving them respite up to a day when the eyes shall remain upraised (in terror).,
1793,They shall be rushing with their heads raised upward; their eyes shall not return towards them and their hearts shall be hollow.,
1794,"Warn the people of a day when punishment will come upon them, and the wrongdoers will say, “Our Lord, give us respite for a short term, and we will respond to Your call and will follow the messengers.” (Allah will say), “Is it not that you had sworn oaths earlier that you would not have to leave (the world)?",
1795,"And you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We put forth for you the examples.”",
1796,"And they worked out their plot and whatever they plot is before Allah, even though their plot is such as would move the mountains.",

1798,"the day on which this earth will be turned into some other earth, and the skies as well, and they all shall appear before Allah, the One, the All-Dominant.",
1799,"On that day you will see the culprits tied up together in chains,",
1800,"their shirts will be of rosin, and their faces will be covered with Fire",
1801,"so that Allah repays everyone in full whatever he earned. Indeed, Allah is swift at reckoning.",

1927,"Those (too) who were before them made plots. Then (the command of) Allah came upon their buildings (uprooting them) from the foundations. So roofs fell down upon them from above, and the chastisement came to them from where they could not even imagine.",

1929,"the ones to whom the angels brought death while they were (still) wronging themselves.” Then, they will resort to submission, (yet will say), “We used to do nothing wrong.” (They will be answered) Why not? Allah knows well what you used to do.",

Excellent is the abode of the God-fearing -",
1932,"the eternal gardens they enter, with rivers flowing beneath them. For them there is what they desire. That is how Allah rewards the God-fearing -",
1933,"the ones to whom angels bring death while they are pure (in beliefs and deeds). They (angels) say, “Peace on you! Enter Paradise for the deeds you have been doing.”",
1934,"They (the unbelievers) are waiting for nothing but that the angels should come to them, or comes the command of your Lord. Similar was the reaction of those who were before them. Allah did not wrong them; rather they were doing wrong to themselves.",
1935,"So, the evils of what they did overtook them, and they were encircled by the very thing they used to ridicule.",
1936,"The polytheists said, “If Allah had so willed, we would have not worshipped anything other than Him - neither we nor our forefathers - nor would we have made anything unlawful without (a command from) Him.” Similar was the reaction of those who were before them.

1937,"We did raise a messenger among every people, with the message: “Worship Allah and stay away from the Rebel (the Satan).” Then, there were some among them whom Allah guided, and there were others against whom deviation (from the right path) was established.

2141,"Praise belongs to Allah who has sent down the Book to His servant, and allowed no crookedness in it,",
2142,"a straightforward Book to warn of a severe punishment from Him, and to give the good news to the believers, who do righteous deeds, that they will have an excellent reward (Paradise)",
2143,"in which they will dwell for ever,",
2144,"and to warn those who have said that Allah has had a son,",
2145,"while they have no knowledge about it, nor had their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths. They say nothing but lie.",
2146,"So, (O Prophet) perhaps you are going to kill yourself after them, out of grief, if they do not believe in this discourse.",
2147,"Surely, We have made what is on earth an adornment for it, so that We test them as to who among them is better in deeds.",
2148,"And surely, We are going to turn whatever is thereon into a barren land.",
2149,Do you think that the People of Kahf (the Cave) and Raqīm (inscription) were unusual out of Our signs?,
2150,"When the young men took refuge in the Cave and said, “Our Lord, bless us with mercy from Your own and provide us with guidance in our matters.”",
2151,"So, We sealed up their hearing (putting them to sleep) in the Cave for a number of years.",
2152,"Thereafter We raised them up, so that We know which of the two groups had better calculated the period in which they remained (sleeping).",
2153,We narrate to you their story with truth. They were young men who believed in their Lord and We gave them more guidance.,
2154,"We made their hearts firm when they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We shall never invoke any god other than Him, otherwise we would be saying something far from the truth.",
2155,"These, our people, have adopted gods other than Him. Why do they not bring a clear proof in their favor? So, who is more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah?",
2156,"When you have turned away from them, and those whom they worship, except Allah, then seek refuge in the cave, and your Lord will extend His mercy for you, and provide you ease in your matters.”",
2157,"You would see the sun, when it rose, turning away from their Cave towards the right; and when it set, it bypassed them towards the left, and they were (lying) in the hollow thereof. That is one of the signs of Allah.Whomsoever Allah guides is the one who gets the right path and whomsoever He lets go astray, for him you will find no one to help, no one to lead.",
2158,"And you would think they were awake while they were asleep. We turned them on their sides, right and left. And their dog had its forelegs stretched out to the doorstep. If you had a look at them, you would have fled away from them and would have been filled with awe of them.",
2159,"In this way We raised them up until they asked each other. One of them said, “How long did you tarry?” They said, “A day, or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long you tarried.” So, send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city and let him look around which of the eatables are the purest and let him bring you some food from there. And he must act in polite manner, and must not let anyone know about you.",
2160,"If they (the habitants of the city) will know about you, they will force you to revert to their faith, and in that case, you will never find success.”",
2161,"And in this way, We made them known to the people (of the city), so that they realize that Allah’s promise is true, and that there is no doubt about the Hour (the Day of Resurrection). When they were disputing among themselves in their matter, they said, “Erect a building over them. Their Lord knows them best.” Said those who prevailed in their matter, “We will certainly make a mosque over them.”",
2162,"Some will say, “(They were) three, the fourth of them being their dog,” and some will say, “Five, the sixth of them being their dog, just making conjectures.” And others will say, “Seven, the eighth of them is their dog.” Say, “My Lord knows best about their number.” No one knows them except a few, so do not argue about them except an apparent argumentation. And do not ask anyone of these about them.",
2163,"And never say about anything, “I will do this tomorrow,”",
2164,"unless (you say - ‘if) Allah wills.’ And remember your Lord if you forget, and say (to those who asked you about the story of the People of the Cave), “May be, my Lord will lead me to something closer than this to guidance.”",
2165,They stayed in their Cave for three hundred years and added nine.,
2166,"Say, “Allah knows best how long they stayed. To Him belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth - how well He sees and how well He hears! They have no supporter other than Him and He lets no one share His authority.”",
2167,"And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no one to change His words, and you will never find a refuge beside Him.",
2168,"Keep yourself content with those who call their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, and let not your eyes overlook them, seeking the splendor of the worldly life. And do not obey the one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who has followed his desire and whose behavior has exceeded the limits.",
2169,"And say, “The truth is from your Lord. Now, whoever so wills may believe and whoever so wills may deny.” Surely, We have prepared for the unjust a fire, whose tent will envelop them. And if they will beg for help, they shall be helped with water like oily dregs that will scald the faces. Vile is the drink, and evil is the Fire as a resting-place.",
2170,"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds,-of course, We do not waste the reward of those who are good in deeds.",
2171,"Those are the ones for whom there are eternal gardens, rivers flowing beneath them. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and they will be dressed in green garments, made of fine silk and thick silk, reclining therein on couches. Excellent is the reward and beautiful is the Paradise as a resting-place.",
2172,"Give them an example. There were two men; We gave one of them two gardens of grapes, and surrounded both of them with date-palms, and placed vegetation between them.",
2173,"Both the gardens brought forth their fruit, and suppressed nothing from it, and We caused a stream to flow through them.",
2174,"And he had wealth. So, he said to his companion while conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and stronger in manpower.”",
2175,"And he entered his garden while he was doing wrong to himself. He said, “I do not think that this will ever perish,",
2176,"and I do not think that the Hour (Day of Judgment) has to come. And even if I am sent back to my Lord, I will surely find a better place than this to resort to.”",
2177,"Said his companion, as he was conversing with him, “Do you deny Him who created you from dust, then from a drop (of semen), then He made you a perfect man?",
2178,"As for me, I believe that Allah is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.",
2179,"Why, when you entered your garden, did you not say, ‘(Everything is) as Allah wills. There is no power except with Allah’? If you see me inferior to you in wealth and children,",
2180,"then, it is likely that my Lord will give me (what is) better than your garden, and will send to it a punishment from the heavens, and it will become a barren land.",
2181,"Or, its water will sink deep in the earth, so that you will never be able to search it out.”",
2182,"And its produce was overwhelmed by calamities and he stood wringing his hands (in anguish) over what he had invested in it, while it was fallen down on its trellises and he was saying, “I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!”",
2183,"There were no supporters for him beside Allah, who could come to his help, nor was he able to defend himself.",
2184,"That is where the power of protection rests with Allah, the True God. He is the best in rewarding and best in requiting.",
2185,"Give them the example of the worldly life; it is like water We sent down from the sky, then the vegetation of the earth was mingled with it, and then it turned into chaff that is blown by the winds, and Allah is powerful over everything.",
2186,"Wealth and children are the embellishment of the worldly life, and the everlasting virtues are better with your Lord, both in rewards and in creating good hopes",
2187,"And (visualize) the Day when We will make mountains move, and you will see the earth fully exposed, and We shall gather them together, so as not to leave a single one of them.",
2188,"And they shall be presented lined-up before your Lord. (It will be said to them,) “Lo! You have come to Us just as We had created you for the first time, while you claimed that We would not make any appointed time for you.”",
2189,"And the book (of deeds) will be placed (before them), then you will see the guilty people scared of its contents and saying, “Woe to us! What a book is this! It has missed nothing, minor or major, but has taken it into account.” Thus they will find whatever they did present before them, and your Lord will not wrong anyone.",
2190,"(Recall) when We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves before ’Ādam.” So, they prostrated themselves, all of them but Iblīs (Satan). He was of the Jinn, so he rebelled against the command of your Lord. Do you still take him and his progeny as friends instead of Me, while they are enemy to you? Evil is he as substitute (of obedience to Allah) for wrongdoers.",
2191,"I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of their own creation. I was not such that I should take the misleaders as helpers.",
2192,"(Recall) the Day when He will say, “Call My ‘partners’ whom you claimed as such.” So, they will call them, but they will not respond to them, and We will put a destructive barrier between them.",
2193,"And the sinners will see the Fire; so they will know that they will have to fall into it, and they will find no way to bypass it.",
2194,"Indeed We have explained in this Qur’ān every subject in various ways for the benefit of the people, but out of all creation, man is most disputing.",
2195,"The only thing that prevented people from believing, even after the guidance had come to them, and from seeking forgiveness from their Lord, is (their demand) that what used to come to the earlier people should come to them as well, or that the punishment should visit them face to face.",
2196,"We send the messengers only as bearers of good tidings and warnings, and those who disbelieve raise disputes on the basis of the false (arguments), so that they may nullify the truth with it; and they have taken My signs, and the warnings given to them, as mockery.",
2197,"Who is more unjust than the one who was reminded through the signs of his Lord, but he turned away from them, and forgot what his own hands sent ahead. Indeed We have put covers on their hearts that bar them from understanding it, and (We have created) deafness in their ears. And if you call them to guidance, even then they will never adopt the right path.",
2198,"Your Lord is the Most Forgiving, the Lord of Mercy. If He seizes them for what they did, He may cause the punishment to befall them sooner, but there is an appointed time for them, from which they can never find a place of refuge.",
2199,"These are the towns that We destroyed when they (i.e. their people) transgressed, and We had appointed a time for their destruction.",
2200,"(Recall) when Mūsā said to his young man, “I shall not give up until I reach the meeting point of the two seas, or else I shall go on traveling for years.”",
2201,"So, when they reached the meeting point of the two seas, they forgot their fish, and it made its way into the sea as in a tunnel.",
2202,"When they went further, he said to his young man, “Bring us our morning meal; we have, indeed, had much fatigue from this journey of ours.”",
2203,"He said, “You see, when we stayed at the rock, I forgot the fish. It was none but Satan who made me forget it to tell you about it - and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner.”",
2204,"He said, “That was what we were looking for.” So they returned, retracing their footsteps.",
2205,"Then they found one of Our servants whom We blessed with mercy from Us and whom We gave knowledge, a knowledge from Our own.",
2206,"Mūsā said to him, “May I have your company so that you teach me some of the rightful knowledge you have been given.”",
2207,"He said, “You can never bear with me patiently.",
2208,And how would you keep patient over something your comprehension cannot grasp?”,
2209,"He (Mūsā) said, “You will find me patient, if Allah wills, and I shall not disobey any order from you.”",
2210,"He said, “Well, if you follow me, do not ask me about anything unless I myself start telling you about it.”",
2211,"So, they both moved ahead, until when they boarded a boat, he sliced it (by removing one of its planks). He (Mūsā) said, “Did you slice it to drown its people? In fact, you have done a terrible act.”",
2212,"He said, “Did I not say that you can never bear with me patiently?”",
2213,"He (Mūsā) said, “Do not hold me punishable for what I forgot, and do not make my course too difficult for me.”",
2214,"So, they moved ahead until when they met a boy, he killed him (the boy). He (Mūsā) said, “Did you kill an innocent soul while he did not kill anyone? You have committed a heinous act indeed.”",
2215,"He said, “Did I not tell you that you can never bear with me patiently?”",
2216,"He (Mūsā) said, “If I ask you about something after this, do not allow me your company. You have now reached a point where you have a valid excuse (to part with me) from my own side. “",
2217,"Then, they moved ahead until they came to the people of a town; they asked its people for food, and they refused to host them. Then, they found there a wall tending to fall down. So he (KhaDir) set it right. He (Mūsā) said, “If you wished, you could have charged a fee for this.”",
2218,"He said, “Here is the point of parting ways between me and you. I shall now explain to you the reality of things about which you could not remain patient.",
2219,"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who worked at sea. So I wanted to make it defective, as there was a king across them who used to usurp every boat by force.",
2220,"As for the boy, his parents were believers. We apprehended that he would impose rebellion and infidelity upon them.",
2221,"We, therefore, wished that their Lord would replace him with someone better than him in piety, and more akin to affection.",
2222,"As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was a treasure beneath it belonging to them, and their father was a pious man. So your Lord willed that they should reach their maturity and dig out their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it on my own accord. This is the reality of things about which you could not remain patient.”",
2223,"They ask you about Dhul-Qarnain. Say, “I shall now recite to you an account of him.”",
2224,"Surely, We gave him power on earth and gave him means to (have) everything (he needs).",
2225,"So he followed a course,",
2226,"until when he reached the point of sunset, he found it setting into a miry spring, and found a people near it. We said, “O Dhul-Qarnain, either punish them or adopt good behavior with them.”",
2227,"He said, “As for him who does wrong, we shall punish him, then he will be sent back to his Lord, and He will punish him with a severe punishment.",
2228,"As for the one who believes and acts righteously, he will have the best (life) as reward, and we shall speak to him politely in our directions.”",
2229,"Thereafter, he followed a course,",
2230,"until when he reached the point of sunrise, he found it rising over a people for whom We did not make any shelter against it.",
2231,"Thus it was, and Our knowledge fully comprehends whatever (wealth and equipment) he had with him.",
2232,Thereafter he followed a course,
2233,"until when he reached between the two mountains, he found by them a people who were almost unable to understand anything said.",
2234,"They said, “O Dhul-Qarnain, the (tribes of) Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj (Gog and Magog) are mischief-makers on the earth. So, should we assign a tax for you on condition that you make a barrier between us and them?”",
2235,"He said, “What my Lord has (already) given in my control is better enough (for me than the tax you are offering to me), so help me (only) with some (man) power, and I shall make a rampart between you and them.",
2236,"Bring me big pieces of iron.” (They proceeded accordingly) until when he leveled up (the gap) between the two cliffs, he said, “Blow.” (They complied) until when he made it (like) fire, he said, “Bring me molten copper, and I will pour it upon this.”",
2237,"So they (Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj) were not able to climb it, nor were they able to make a hole in it.",
2238,"He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. Then, when the promise of my Lord will come, He will make it leveled to the ground. The promise of my Lord is true.”",
2239,"And on that day, (i.e. the Doomsday) We will leave them (all the people including Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj) surging over one another. And the Horn shall be blown, then We shall gather them together.",
2240,And on that day We will bring Jahannam fully exposed before the infidels,
2241,"whose eyes were under a cover against My reminders, and they were not able to listen.",
2242,"Do, then, the disbelievers deem (it fit) that they take My servants as patrons beside Me? Surely, We have prepared Jahannam as entertainment for the disbelievers.",
2243,"Say, “Shall We tell you about the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds?",
2244,"Those are the ones whose effort in the worldly life has gone in vain, while they think they are doing well.",
2245,"Those are the ones who rejected the signs of their Lord and (the concept of) meeting with Him, so their deeds have gone to waste, and We shall assign to them no weight at all.",
2246,"That is their punishment, the Jahannam , for they disbelieved and made My signs and My messengers a mockery.",
2247,"Surely those who believed and did righteous deeds, theirs are the Gardens of Firdaus as entertainment",
2248,"where they will live forever, and will not wish to move from there.”",
2249,"Say, “If the ocean were to be ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, the ocean would have been consumed before the Words of my Lord are exhausted, even though we were to bring another (ocean) like it in addition.”",
2250,"Say, “Surely, I am but a human being like you; it is revealed to me that your God is the One God. So the one who hopes to meet his Lord must do righteous deed and must not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.”",
2251,"Kāf, Hā Yā, ‘Ain, Sād",
2252,"This is a narration of your Lord’s mercy to His servant Zakariyyā,",
2253,When he called his Lord in a low voice.,
2254,"He said, “My Lord, I am in a state that bones in my body have turned feeble, and the head has flared up grey with old age, and I never remained, My Lord, unanswered in my prayer to You.",
2255,"I fear (my) kinsmen after me, and my wife is barren, so bless me with an heir, from Your own side,",
2256,"who inherits me and inherits the house of Ya‘qūb. And make him, My Lord, a favourite one.”",
2257,"(Allah said) “O Zakariyyā, We give you the good news of a boy whose name is YaHyā. We did not create any one before him of the same name.”",
2258,"He Said, “My Lord, how shall there be a boy for me while my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme of old age?”",
2259,"He said, “So it is; your Lord said ‘it is easy for Me, and I did create you before, when you were nothing.’”",
2260,"He said, “My Lord, make for me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not (be able to) speak to the people for three (consecutive) nights, even though you will be sound in health.”",
2261,"Then he came out to his people from the place of prayer, and directed them by gestures to proclaim the purity of Allah at morning and evening.",
2262,"(When the child was born, Allah said to him,) “O YaHyā, hold on to the Book firmly.” And We gave him wisdom, while he was still a child,",
2263,"and (blessed him with) love from our own, and purity; and he was God-fearing,",
2264,and he was good to his parents; and he was not oppressive (or) disobedient.,
2265,"Peace on him the day he was born, the day he dies and the day he will be raised alive.",
2266,"And mention in the Book (the story of) Maryam, when she secluded herself from her people to a place towards East,",
2267,"then she used a barrier to hide herself from them. Then, We sent to her Our Spirit, (Jibra’īl) and he took before her the form of a perfect human being.",
2268,"She said, “I seek refuge with the All-Merciful (Allah) against you, if you are God-fearing.”",
2269,"He said, “I am but a message-bearer of your Lord (sent) to give you a boy, purified.”",
2270,"She said, “How shall I have a boy while no human has ever touched me, nor have I ever been unchaste?”",
2271,"He said, “So it is; your Lord said, ‘It is easy for Me, and (We will do this) so that We make it a sign for people and a mercy from Us, and this is a matter already destined.’”",
2272,"So she conceived him, and went in seclusion with him to a remote place.",
2273,"Then the labour pains brought her to the trunk of a palm-tree. She said “O that I would have died before this, and would have been something gone, forgotten.”",
2274,Then he called her from beneath her: “Do not grieve; your Lord has placed a stream beneath you.,
2275,"Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards yourself and, it will drop upon you ripe fresh dates.",
2276,"So eat, drink and cool your eyes. Then if you see any human being, say (to him), “I have vowed a fast (of silence) for the All-Merciful (Allah,) and therefore, I shall never speak to any human today.”",
2277,"Then she came to her people carrying him (the baby). They said, “O Maryam you have committed something grave indeed.",
2278,"O sister of Hārūn, neither your father was a man of evil nor was your mother unchaste.”",
2279,"So, she pointed towards him (the baby). They said, “How shall we speak to someone who is still a child in the cradle?”",
2280,"Spoke he (the baby), “Verily I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Book, and made me a prophet,",
2281,"and He has made me a blessed one wherever I be, and has enjoined Salāh and Zakāh upon me as long as I am alive,",
2282,"and (He has made me) good to my mother, and he did not make me oppressive (or) ill-fated.",
2283,"And peace is upon me the day I was born, the day I shall die, and the day I shall be raised alive again.”",
2284,"That is ‘Īsā, the son of Maryam, to say the truth in which they (Christians) are disputing.",
2285,"It is not for Allah to have a son. Pure is He. When He decides a thing, He simply says to it, “Be” and it comes to be.",
2286,"And (O Prophet, say to the people,) “Allah is surely my Lord and your Lord. So, worship Him. This is the straight path.”",
2287,"Then the groups among them fell in dispute. So, how evil is the fate of the disbelievers when they have to face the Great Day.",
2288,"How strong will their hearing be, and how strong their vision, the day they will come to Us! But today the transgressors are straying in clear error.",
2289,"Warn them of The Day of Remorse when the whole thing will be settled, while they are heedless and do not believe.",
2290,"Surely We, only We, shall be the ultimate owner of the earth and all those on it, and to Us they will be returned.",
2291,"And mention in the Book (the story of) Ibrāhīm. Indeed, he was Siddīq (a man of truth), a prophet,",
2292,"when he said to his father, “My dear father, why do you worship something that does neither hear nor see, nor help you in any way?",
2293,"My dear father, indeed there has come to me a knowledge that has not come to you; so, follow me, and I shall lead you to a straight path.",
2294,"My dear father, do not worship the Satan. The Satan is surely rebellious to the All-Merciful, (Allah).",
2295,"My dear father, I fear lest a punishment from the All- Merciful (Allah) should afflict you, and you become a companion of Satan.”",
2296,"He said, “Are you averse to my gods O Ibrāhīm? Should you not stop, I will definitely stone you. And leave me for good.”",
2297,"He said, “Peace on you. I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord. He has always been gracious to me.",
2298,And I go away from you and what you invoke besides Allah. And I shall invoke my Lord. Hopefully I shall not be a loser by invoking my Lord.”,
2299,"So, when he went away from them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We blessed him with IsHāq (Isaac) and Ya‘qūb (Jacob) and We made each one of them a prophet,",
2300,"and We bestowed on them (a great deal) of our mercy, and caused them to have a good name at a high level.",
2301,"And mention in the Book (the story of) Mūsā. Indeed he was a chosen one and was a messenger, a prophet.",
2302,"And We called him from the right side of the mount Tūr (Sinai), and We brought him close to communicate in secret.",
2303,"And, out of Our mercy, We granted him his brother Hārūn as a prophet.",
2304,"And mention in the Book (the story of) Ismā‘īl. He was indeed true to his promise, and was a messenger, a prophet.",
2305,"He used to enjoin Salāh and Zakāh upon his family, and was favourite to his Lord.",
2306,"And mention in the Book (the story of) Idrīs. He was indeed a Siddīq (man of truth), a prophet.",
2307,We raised him to a high place.,
2308,"Those are the people whom Allah has blessed with bounties, the prophets from the progeny of ’Ādam, and of those whom We caused to board (the Ark) along with NūH, and from the progeny of Ibrāhīm and Isrā’īl (Jacob), and from those whom We guided and selected. When the verses of The RaHmān (The All-Merciful) were recited before them, they used to fall down in Sajdah (prostration), while they were weeping.",
2309,"Then came after them the successors who neglected Salāh and followed (their selfish) desires. So they will soon face (the outcome of their) deviation,",

2311,"(They will enter) the Gardens of eternity, promised by the All-Merciful (Allah) to His servants, in the unseen world. They will surely reach (the places of) His promise.",
2312,"They will not hear anything absurd therein, but a word of peace, and there they will have their provision at morn and eve.",
2313,That is the Paradise We will give as inheritance to those of Our servants who have been God-fearing.,
2314,(Jibra’īl X said to the Holy Prophet) “We do not descend but with the command of your Lord. To Him belongs what is in front of us and what is behind us and what is in between; and your Lord is not the One who forgets.,

2319,"Then, out of every group, We will certainly draw out those who were more rebellious against the All-Merciful (Allah).",
2320,"Then of course, We are most aware of those who are more deserving to enter it (the Jahannam ).",
2321,"There is none among you who does not have to arrive at it. This is undertaken by your Lord as an absolute decree, bound to be enforced.",
2322,"Then We will save those who feared Allah, and will leave the wrongdoers in it, fallen on their knees.",
2323,"When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, the disbelievers say to the believers, “Which of the two groups is superior in its place and better in its assembly?”",
2324,How many a generation We have destroyed before them who were better in assets and outlook!,
2325,"Say, “Whoever stays straying, let his term be extended by the All-Merciful (Allah) still longer, until when they will see what they are being warned of: either the punishment or the Hour (of Doom), then they will know who was worse in his place and weaker in his forces.",
2326,Allah makes those on the right path excel in guidance. And the everlasting virtues are better with your Lord in respect of reward and better in their return.,
2327,"Have you, then, seen him who rejected Our verses and said, “I shall certainly be given wealth and children”?",
2328,Has he peeped into the Unseen or taken a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah)?,
2329,Never! We will write what he says and extend for him the punishment extensively.,
2330,"And We will inherit from him what he is talking about, and he will come to Us all alone.",
2331,"They have taken gods other than Allah, so that they may be a source of might for them.",
2332,"Never! They (their fabricated deities) will soon reject their having worshipped them, and they will be just the opposite for them.",
2333,Have you not seen that We have sent the devils onto the disbelievers inciting them with all their incitements.,
2334,So make no hurry about them; We are but counting for them a count down.,
2335,"The day We will assemble the God-fearing before the All-Merciful (Allah) as guests,",
2336,"and will drive the sinners towards the Jahannam as herds of cattle (are driven) towards water,",
2337,"none will have power to intercede, except the one who has entered into a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah).",
2338,"They say, “The All-Merciful (Allah) has got a son.”",
2339,Indeed you have come up with such an abominable statement,
2340,"that the heavens are well-nigh to explode at it, and the earth to burst apart, and the mountains to fall down crumbling,",
2341,"for they have ascribed a son to the All-Merciful (Allah),",
2342,while it does not behove the All-Merciful to have a son.,
2343,"There is none in the heavens and the earth, but bound to come to the All-Merciful as a salve.",
2344,"He has fully encompassed them and precisely calculated their numbers,",
2345,"and each one of them is bound to come to Him on the Day of Judgment, all alone.",
2346,"Surely, those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them the All-Merciful (Allah) will create love.",
2347,"So We have made it (the Qur’ān) easy through your tongue, so that you give with it the good news to the God-fearing, and warn with it an obstinate people.",
2348,"And how many a generation We have destroyed before them! Do you sense (the presence of) any one of them, or hear from them even a whisper?",
2349,Tā-Hā,
2350,We did not reveal the Qur’ān to you to (make you) face hardship,
2351,"rather to remind him who has the fear (of Allah),",
2352,"it being a revelation from the One Who created the earth, and high heavens.",
2353,"The RaHmān (Allah, the All-Merciful) has positioned Himself on the Throne.",
2354,"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens, all that is in the earth and whatever lies between them and whatever lies beneath the soil.",
2355,"If you pronounce the word aloud, then (it makes no difference, for) He certainly knows the secret and what is even more hidden.",
2356,(Such is) Allah. There is no god but He. For Him are the Beautiful Names.,
2357,Has there come to you the story of Mūsā?,
2358,"When he saw a fire and said to his family, “Stay here. I have noticed a fire. Perhaps I can bring you an ember from it, or find some guidance by the fire.”",
2359,"So when he came to it, he was called, “O Mūsā,",
2360,"it is Me, your Lord, so remove your shoes; you are in the sacred valley of Tuwā.",
2361,"I have chosen you (for prophet-hood), so listen to what is revealed:",
2362,"Surely, I AM ALLAH. There is no god but Myself, so worship Me, and establish Salāh for My remembrance.",
2363,"Surely, the Hour (i.e. the Day of Judgment) has to come. I would keep it secret, so that everyone is given a return for the effort one makes.",
2364,"So the one who does not believe in it and follows his desires must not make you neglectful of it, otherwise you will perish.",
2365,"And what is that in your right hand, O Mūsā?”",
2366,"He said, “It is my staff. I lean on it, and I beat down leaves with it for my sheep, and I have many other uses for it.”",
2367,"He said, “Throw it down O Mūsā”.",
2368,"So, he threw it down, and suddenly it was a snake, running around.",
2369,"He said, “Pick it up, and be not scared. We shall restore it to its former state.",
2370,"And press your hand under your arm, and it will come out (brightly) white without any disease, as another sign,",
2371,so that We may show you some of Our great signs.,
2372,Go to Pharaoh. He has really exceeded all bounds.”,
2373,"He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace for me,",
2374,and make my task easy for me,
2375,"and remove the knot from my tongue,",
2376,so that they may understand my speech.,
2377,"And make for me an assistant from my own family,",
2378,"that is, Hārūn, my brother.",
2379,"Enhance with him my strength,",
2380,"and make him share my task,",
2381,so that we proclaim Your purity in abundance,
2382,and remember You in abundance.,
2383,You are certainly watchful over us.”,
2384,"He said, “You have been granted your request O Mūsā.",
2385,"And We had bestowed Our favour on you another time,",
2386,"when We revealed to your mother what was to be revealed,",
2387,"that is, ‘Put him (the baby) in the chest, then cast it into the river, then let the river throw it by the shore, and it will be picked up by one who is enemy to Me and enemy to him.’ And I had cast love on you from Myself (so that you might be favourite of all), and that you might be brought up under My eye.",
2388,"(Remember) when your sister was going (to the family of Pharaoh) and was saying, ‘Shall I lead you to one who nurses him?’ Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that her eyes might have comfort and she might not grieve. And you had killed a person, then We brought you out of the trouble; and We tested you with a great ordeal. Then you lived a number of years amidst the people of Madyan. After all this, you came O Mūsā, to a destined point of time.",
2389,I have fashioned you for Myself.,
2390,"Go, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not be slack in My remembrance.",
2391,"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh; he has indeed transgressed all limits.",
2392,"So speak to him in soft words. May be, he accepts the advice or fears (Allah)”.",
2393,"They said, “Our Lord, we fear that he will hasten against us, or will become (more) rebellious (against You).”",
2394,"He said, “Do not be afraid. I AM surely with you both. I hear and I see.",
2395,"So, come to him and say, ‘We are the messengers of your Lord. So, let the children of Isrā’īl go with us, and do not persecute them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord; and peace be upon the one who follows the guidance.",
2396,"Verily, it has been revealed to us that the punishment is for the one who denies and turns away.’”",
2397,"He (Pharaoh) said, “Who then is the Lord of you two, O Mūsā?”",
2398,"He (Mūsā) said, “Our Lord is the One who gave everything its due shape, then guided it.”",
2399,"He said, “Then, what is the status of the earlier generations?”",
2400,"He replied, “The knowledge about those is with my Lord in a Book. My Lord does neither err nor forget.”",
2401,"(He is) the One who made the earth a cradle for you, and made in it pathways for you to move, and sent down water from the heavens; and We brought forth with it pairs of different vegetations :",
2402,"Eat, and graze your cattle. Surely, in that there are signs for the people of understanding.",
2403,"From this (dust) We created you, and in this we shall put you back, and from this We shall raise you up once again.",
2404,"And We showed him (Pharaoh) all Our signs, yet he rejected and refused.",
2405,"Said he, “Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your sorcery, O Mūsā?",
2406,"We will, then, bring to you a similar sorcery. So, make an appointment between you and us for an even place, not to be backed out, neither by us nor by you.”",
2407,"He (Mūsā) said, “Your appointment is the festival day, and the people should be assembled at forenoon.”",
2408,"So, Pharaoh turned back, and put his plot together, then came.",
2409,"Mūsā said to them, “Pity on you, do not fabricate a lie against Allah, lest He should destroy you with a punishment. And loser is he who fabricates a lie.”",
2410,"Then, they disputed among themselves in their matter, and kept their talk secret.",
2411,"Said they, “Certainly, these two are sorcerers who wish to drive you out from your land, and do away with your excellent way of life.",
2412,"So, make your plot firm and come forth in one row. Successful today is the one who prevails.”",
2413,"They said, “O Mūsā, either you throw (first), or shall we be first to throw?”",
2414,"He said, “Rather, you throw.” Then, suddenly their ropes and sticks seemed to him, due to their magic, as if they were running.",
2415,"So, Mūsā concealed some fear in his heart.",
2416,"We said, “Do not be scared. Certainly, you are to be the upper most.",
2417,"And throw what is in your right hand, and it will devour what they have concocted. What they have concocted is but a sleight of a magician. And the magician does not succeed wherever he comes from.”",
2418,"So, the magicians were led (by the truth) to fall in prostration. They said, “We have (now) believed in the Lord of Hārūn and Mūsā.”",
2419,"He (Pharaoh) said, “You have believed in him before I permit you. This man is in fact your master who has taught you the magic. So I will certainly cut off your hands and your legs from opposite sides, and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you shall know whose punishment, out of us, is more severe and more lasting.”",
2420,"They said, “We will never prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us, and over Him who has created us. So, decide whatever you have to decide. You will decide only for this worldly life.",
2421,"We have put our faith in our Lord, so that He forgives us for our sins and for the magic you compelled us to perform. And Allah is the Best and Everlasting.”",
2422,"Surely whoever comes to his Lord as a sinner, for him there is Jahannam in which he neither will die nor will live (a happy life).",
2423,"And whoever will come to Him as believer, having done righteous deeds, for such people there are the highest ranks,",
2424,"the eternal gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they shall live for ever. That is the reward for the one who has purified himself.",
2425,"And We revealed to Mūsā saying, “Set out with my servants at night, then make for them a dry path across the sea (with the strike of your staff), neither fearing to be caught up, nor having any fear (of drowning).”",
2426,"Then Pharaoh chased them with his troops. So, they were encircled by that (huge wave) from the sea which overwhelmed them.",
2427,"Pharaoh held his people astray, and did not show them the right path.",
2428,"O children of Isrā’īl , We delivered you from your enemy and appointed for you the right side of the mount Tūr (Sinai), and sent down for you the Mann and Salwā :",
2429,"Eat from the good things We have provided to you, and do not exceed the limits in it, lest My wrath should descend on you. The one upon whom My wrath descends certainly falls into destruction.",
2430,"Surely I am the Most-Forgiving for him who repents and believes and acts righteously, then follows the right path.",
2431,"“What has caused you to hurry before your people, O Mūsā?”",
2432,"He said, “Here they are just behind me, and I hurried towards You, my Lord, so that You be pleased.”",
2433,"He said, “We have then put your people to test after you (left them) and Sāmiriyy has misguided them.”",
2434,"So, Mūsā went back to his people, angry and sad. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Did then the time become too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord befalls you, and hence you broke your promise to me?”",
2435,"They said, “We did not break our promise to you of our own accord, but we were burdened with loads from the ornaments of the people;so we threw them, and thus did Sāmiriyy cast.”",
2436,"Then he brought forth for them a calf, which was (merely) a body with a lowing sound. Then they said, “This is your god and the god of Mūsā, and he (Mūsā) erred.”",
2437,"Have they not been seeing that it did not respond to them (even) with a word, nor did it have power to harm or benefit them?",
2438,"Hārūn had already said to them, “O my people, you have only been led astray with it, and your Lord is the RaHmān (All-Merciful). So follow me and obey my command.”",
2439,"They said, “We will never cease to stay with it in devotion, until Mūsā returns to us.”",
2440,"He (Mūsā) said, “O Hārūn, what did prevent you from following me when you saw them going astray?",
2441,Did you then disobey my command?”,
2442,"He said, “O son of my mother, do not hold me by my beard, nor by my head. I feared that you would say, ‘You have caused discord among the children of Isrā’īl and did not observe my advice.’”",
2443,"He (Mūsā) said, “What then is your case, O Sāmiriyy?”",
2444,"He said, “I perceived something they did not perceive. So I picked up a handful from under the footstep of the messenger. Then, I cast it. And thus my inner self tempted me.”",
2445,"He (Mūsā) said, “Then go away; it is destined for you that, throughout your life, you will say: ‘Do not touch me’. And, of course, you have another promise that will not be broken for you. And look at your god to which you stayed devoted. We will certainly burn it, then we will scatter it thoroughly in the sea.",
2446,Your God is Allah other than whom there is no god. He encompasses everything with knowledge.”,
2447,"This is how We narrate to you certain events of what has passed, and We have given to you, from Ourself, a (book of) advice.",
2448,"Whoever turns away from it shall certainly bear a heavy burden on Doomsday,",
2449,all such people living under it forever. And how evil for them will be that burden on the Doomsday!,
2450,"The Day when the Horn (Sūr) will be blown, and We shall gather them together while they will have turned blue on that day,",
2451,"and will be whispering among themselves, “You did not remain (in graves) more than ten (days)”.",
2452,"We know very well what they say, when the best of them in his ways will say, “You did not remain more than one day.”",
2453,"They ask you about the mountains. So, say (to them), “My Lord will crush them into dust thoroughly,",
2454,then will turn them into a leveled plain,
2455,in which you will see neither a curve nor an uneven place.”,
2456,"That day they will follow the caller who will find no deviation (from anyone). And the voices will turn low in awe for the RaHmān (All-Merciful, Allah). So, you will hear not but whispering.",
2457,"That day no intercession will be of any use to anyone, except the one whom the RaHmān (All-Merciful, Allah) has permitted and was pleased with his word.",
2458,"He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them, and they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge.",
2459,"All faces will be humbled before (Allah,) the Ever-Alive, the All-Sustaining; and the loser will be the one who bears (the burden of his) injustice.",
2460,"But whoever does righteous deeds, while he is a believer, shall fear neither injustice nor curtailment (of his rewards).",
2461,"And in this way We have sent it down to you as an Arabic Qur’ān, and have detailed in it some warnings in various ways, so that they may fear, or it may produce a lesson for them.",
2462,"So High above all is Allah, the True King! And do not hasten with (reciting) the Qur’ān before its revelation to you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, improve me in knowledge.”",
2463,"We had given a directive to ’Ādam earlier, then he forgot, and We did not find in him a firm resolve.",
2464,"When We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to ’Ādam”. So, all of them fell prostrate, except Iblīs , who refused.",
2465,"So, We said “’Ādam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not expel you from Paradise, lest you should get into trouble.",
2466,"Here you have the privilege that you will not be hungry nor will you be unclad,",
2467,"and you will not be thirsty, nor will you be exposed to sun.”",
2468,"Then the Satan instigated him. He said, “’Ādam, shall I guide you to the tree of eternity and to an empire that does not decay?”",
2469,"So, both of them Ādam and Hawwā’ (Eve)] ate from it, and their parts of shame were exposed to them, and they started stitching on themselves some of the leaves of Paradise. And ’Ādam disobeyed his Lord, and erred.",
2470,Thereafter his Lord chose him. So He accepted his repentance and gave (him) guidance.,
2471,"He said (to ’Ādam and Iblīs), “Go down from here, all of you, some of you enemies of some others. Then, should some guidance come to you from Me, the one who follows My guidance shall not go astray, nor shall he be in trouble.",
2472,"As for the one who turns away from My message, he shall have a straitened life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Judgment.”",
2473,"He will say, “My Lord, why did you raise me blind while I was sighted?”",
2474,"He will say, “In the similar manner as Our signs came to you, and you had ignored them. In the same way you will be ignored today.”",
2475,Thus We recompense him who exceeds the limits and does not believe in the signs of his Lord. Certainly the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.,
2476,"Did it give them no guidance (to realize) how many generations We have destroyed prior to them in whose dwellings they (often) walk around? Surely, in this there are signs for the men of reason.",
2477,"But for a word from your Lord that had passed earlier, and an appointed time that had been fixed, it (the punishment) would have been inevitable (for them).",
2478,"So, (O messenger,) endure with patience what they say, and proclaim the purity and praise of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset. And in some hours of night, proclaim His purity, and at points of the day as well, so that you may be pleased.",
2479,"Never stretch your eyes towards the things We have given to some groups of them to enjoy, so that We put them to test thereby, it being merely glamour of the worldly life. And the bounty of your Lord is much better and more lasting.",
2480,"Bid your family to perform Salāh, and adhere to it yourself. We ask no provision from you. We give provision to you. And the ultimate end is in favour of Taqwā (God-fearing, and piety).",
2481,"They say, “Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord?” Has there not come to them the clear sign of what is contained in the earlier Scriptures?",
2482,"And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before it, they would have said, “Our Lord, why did you not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and put to disgrace?”",
2483,"Say, “Everyone is waiting. So wait, then you will know who the people of the straight path are and who has followed the right guidance.”",
2484,"The reckoning of the people has drawn near to them, while they are in negligence, turning away (from its signs).",
2485,"No fresh message of advice comes to them from their Lord, but they listen to it as if they were playing,",
2486,"their hearts paying no heed. And the wrongdoers whisper in secret, “This one is nothing but a mortal like you. Would you then go along with sorcery while you can see (the reality)?”",
2487,"He (the prophet) said, “My Lord knows all that is spoken in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”",
2488,"Further they said, “(The Qur’ān is) a mixture of jumble dreams. Rather, he (the prophet) has fabricated it. Rather, he is a poet. So, let him bring a sign to us, as the earlier ones were sent with.”",
2489,"Not a single town from those whom We destroyed came to believe before them. So, will they believe?",
2490,"And We did not send before you messengers except men whom We inspired with revelation. So, ask the people (having the knowledge) of the Message, if you do not know.",
2491,"We did not make them such bodies as ate no food, nor were they immortal.",
2492,"Then We caused the promise to come true for them, so We saved them and those whom We willed, and destroyed the transgressors.",
2493,"Surely, We have sent down to you (O people of Arabia) a book having a good counsel for you. So, do you not understand?",
2494,"How many a town, that were unjust, have We crushed and raised up after them another people!",
2495,"So, as soon as they sensed Our punishment (approaching them), they started fleeing from it.",
2496,"(It was said to them,) “Do not flee, and go back to the luxuries you were made to enjoy, and to your dwellings. May be you are asked questions.”",
2497,"They said, “Alas for us! We were wrongdoers indeed.”",
2498,"Then, this continued to be their cry till We turned them into stubble, totally extinguished.",
2499,We did not create the heavens and the earth and what lies between them for play.,
2500,"Had We intended to have a pastime, We would have had it from Our own, if We were ever to do so.",
2501,"Instead, We launch the truth against falsehood, which gets it smashed, and in no time it is gone. Alas to you for what you describe!",
2502,"To Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth. And those who are near to Him are not arrogant against His worship, nor are they sluggish.",
2503,"They proclaim His purity night and day, never slackening.",
2504,"Or have they adopted gods from the earth, who raise the dead?",
2505,"Had there been gods beside Allah, in the heavens and the earth, both of them would have fallen in disorder. So pure is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from what they describe.",
2506,"He is not questioned of what He does, and they are questioned.",
2507,"Is it that they have adopted gods besides Him? Say, “Bring your proof.” Here is the (book carrying) advice for those with me, and the (books carrying) advice for those before me. Yet most of them do not know the truth, and therefore they are averse.",
2508,"We did not send before you any messenger but We revealed to him that there is no god but I, so worship Me.”",
2509,"They said, “The RaHmān (the All-Merciful, Allah) has taken children for Himself.” Pure is He (from having children). They are but (His) honored servants.",
2510,"They do not precede Him in speech, and only under His command they act.",
2511,"He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them, and they make recommendation for none but for whom He likes, and in awe of Him they are fearful.",
2512,"Should any one of them say, “I am god besides Him”, We will recompense him with Jahannam (Hell). This is how We recompense the transgressors.",
2513,"Did the disbelievers not observe that the heavens and the earth were closed, then We opened them? And We created from water every living thing. Would they still not believe?",
2514,"And We created mountains on the earth, lest it should shake with them, and We have made therein paths and ways, so that they are guided.",
2515,We made the sky a protected roof; and they are averse to its signs.,
2516,"He is the One who has created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each floating in an orbit.",
2517,"We did not assign immortality to any human (even) before you. So, if you die, will they live for ever?",
2518,"Every one has to taste death, and We test you through bad and good (situations) with a trial, and to Us you are to be returned.",
2519,"When disbelievers see you, they do nothing but take you in jest (saying to one another,) “Is this the one who talks of your gods?” - while they themselves reject even talking of the RaHmān (All-Merciful).",
2520,"Man is made of haste. I shall show you My signs, so do not seek haste from Me.",
2521,"They say, “When will this promise be (fulfilled), if you are true?”",
2522,"Only if the disbelievers were to know the time when they will not (be able to) keep off the fire from their faces or from their backs, nor will they be helped.",
2523,"Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and will baffle them. So they will not be able to turn it back, nor will they be given respite.",
2524,"In fact, messengers have been mocked at prior to you. So those who laughed at them were besieged by what they used to ridicule.",
2525,"Say, “Who will guard you, during night and day, against the RaHmān (All-Merciful, Allah)?” Rather, to the remembrance of their Lord they are averse.",
2526,"Or do they have gods who protect them besides Us? They are not able to help even themselves, nor will they have anyone to side with them against Us.",
2527,"But We have given benefits to these and their fathers until life was prolonged for them. So do they not see that We are coming to the land narrowing it down from all its sides? Then, are they the ones to prevail?",
2528,"Say, “I warn you only by revelation, but the deaf do not listen to the call when they are warned.”",
2529,"If a whiff of your Lord’s torment were to touch them, they would certainly say, “Alas to us! We were wrongdoers indeed.”",
2530,"We shall place scales to do justice on the Day of Judgment. So no one shall be wronged in the least. Even if it (a deed) is to the measure of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth, and We are enough to take account.",
2531,"And We gave Mūsā and Hārūn the Criterion, and a light and an advice for the God-fearing,",
2532,"- those who have awe of their Lord without having seen Him, and are fearful of the Hour (of Judgment).",
2533,And this is a blessed advice We have sent down. Are you still rejecting it?,
2534,"Even earlier We had given Ibrāhīm his right course, and We knew him well",
2535,"when he said to his father and his people, “What are these statues you are devoted to?”",
2536,"They said, “We found our fathers worshipping them,”",
2537,"He said, “Surely you and your fathers have been in open error.”",
2538,"They said, “Did you come to us with truth or are you one of the triflers?”",
2539,"He said, “No, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who has created them, and I am one of those who bear witness to it.",
2540,And I swear by Allah that I will devise something against your idols after you have gone away turning your backs.”,
2541,"Then, he turned all of them into pieces, except the big one of them, so that they may come back to it.",
2542,"They said, “Who has done this to our gods? He is one of the wrongdoers indeed.”",
2543,"Some of them said, “We have heard a youth talking about them. He is called Ibrāhīm.”",
2544,"They said, “Then, bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may see”.",
2545,"They said, “Is it you O Ibrāhīm who has done this to our gods?”",
2546,"He said, “Rather, this is done by this chief of theirs. So, ask them if they can speak.”",
2547,"So they turned to one another and said, “In fact, you yourselves are the wrongdoers.”",
2548,"Then, hanging their heads they reversed their position (and replied to Ibrāhīm,) “You already knew that they do not speak.”",
2549,"He said, “Do you then worship, beside Allah, what does neither benefit you in the least nor harm you?",
2550,Fie upon you and upon what you worship other than Allah. Do you then not understand?”,
2551,"They said, “(O people) burn him and help your gods, if you are to take action.”",
2552,"We said, “O fire, be cold and safe for Ibrāhīm.”",
2553,"And they intended to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.",
2554,And We rescued him and LūT towards the land we blessed for all the worlds.,
2555,"And We blessed him with IsHāq and Ya‘qūb as gift, and each one of them We made righteous.",
2556,"And We made them the Imams who guided (people) under Our command, and We inspired them to do good deeds and to establish Salāh and pay Zakāh, and Us alone they worshipped.",
2557,"As for LūT, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town that used to do dirty deeds. Indeed, they were the people of evil, the sinners.",
2558,"And We admitted him to Our mercy. Indeed, He was of the righteous.",
2559,"And (remember) NūH, when he called (for help) earlier, so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the terrible agony,",
2560,"and helped him against the people who gave the lie to Our verses. Indeed, they were the people of evil, therefore, We drowned them all.",
2561,"And (remember) Dawūd (David) and Sulaimān (Solomon), when they were adjudicating about the tillage in which the goats of other people wandered at night (and trampled it), and We were witness to their judgment.",
2562,"So, We enabled Sulaimān to understand it. And to each one of them We gave wisdom and knowledge. And with Dawūd We subjugated the mountains that pronounced tasbīH (Allah’s purity), and the birds as well. And We were the One who did (it).",
2563,We taught him the skill of making armor as dress for you to protect you from what may harm you (in combat). So are you grateful?,
2564,"And for Sulaimān, (We subjugated) the violent wind that blew under his command to the land in which We placed Our blessings. And We were the One who knew everything.",
2565,"And from the devils, (We subjugated for him) those who dived in water for him and did jobs other than that. And We were the One who kept watch over them.",
2566,"And (remember) Ayyūb (Job), when he called his Lord saying, “Here I am, afflicted by pain and You are the most merciful of all the merciful.”",
2567,"So, We answered his prayer and removed whatever pain he had, and gave him (back) his family and the like thereof along with them, as a mercy from Our own Self and as a lesson for the worshippers.",
2568,And (remember) Ismā‘īl and Idrīs and Dhul-Kifl. Each one of them was of those who observed patience.,
2569,"And We admitted them to Our mercy. Surely, they were of the righteous.",
2570,"And (remember) Dhunnūn (the man of the fish, namely Yūnus X), when he walked away in anger and thought that We would never put him to trouble. Then, he called (Us) in depths of darkness saying, “There is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed I was among the wrongdoers”.",
2571,So We responded to him and rescued him from the distress. And this is how We rescue the believers.,
2572,"And (remember) Zakariyyā when he called his Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone and You are the best of inheritors.”",
2573,"So, We responded to him and gave him YaHyā and made his wife good for him. They used to race towards the good deeds and call Us with hope and fear; and they were humble to Us.",
2574,"And (remember) her who protected her private part (that is, Maryam). So, We blew in her (a life) through Our Spirit, and made her and her son (‘Īsā X) a sign for all the worlds.",
2575,"Surely, this is the fraternity of your Faith, a single Faith, and I am your Lord; so worship Me.",
2576,But they have separated their ways from one another. All of them have to return to Us.,
2577,"So, whoever does righteous deeds, while he is a believer, his effort will not be rejected, and We are to put it on record.",
2578,It is banned for (the people of) a town that We destroyed that they come back,
2579,"until when the Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj (Gog and Magog) are released, while they run down from every height,",
2580,"and the True Promise draws near, then it will so happen that the eyes of the disbelievers shall remain upraised (in terror, and they will say,) “Alas to us! We were in negligence about this; rather we were transgressors.”",
2581,"Surely, you and whatever you worship other than Allah are the fuel of Jahannam.. There you will have to arrive.",
2582,"Had they been gods, they would not have arrived at it, and all of them will remain there forever.",
2583,"For them, there will be screams in it and they will not hear.",
2584,"As for those for whom the good (news) from Us has come earlier, they will be kept far away from it.",
2585,"They will not hear the slightest of its sound, and they will remain forever in what their souls desire.",
2586,"They shall not be grieved by the Biggest Panic, and the angels shall receive them (saying), “This is your day that you had been promised”",
2587,"- the Day when We roll up the sky like a scroll rolls up the writings. Just as We originated the first creation, so We shall bring it back again - a promise (undertaken to be binding) on Us. We are sure to do it.",
2588,And We have written in Zabūr (Psalms) after the advice that the land will be inherited by My righteous slaves.,
2589,"Surely, in this (Qur’ān) there is a message conveyed to a people who worship (Allah).",
2590,And We have not sent you but as mercy for all the worlds.,
2591,"Say, “What is revealed to me is simply that your God is One God. So do you submit?”",
2592,"But, if they turn away, then say (to them), “I have warned you all alike, and I do not know whether what you have been warned of is near or far.",
2593,"Surely, He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you conceal.",
2594,And I do not know; perhaps it is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a while.”,
2595,"He (Our Messenger) said, “My Lord, judge with truth. And Our Lord is the RaHmān (All-Merciful), the One whose help is sought against what you describe.",
2596,"O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed the quake of the (destined) Hour is something terrible.",
2597,"The day you will see it, every suckling female will forget that which she suckles, and every female having pregnancy shall abort her fetus, and you will see people as if they are drunk, while they are not drunk, but Allah’s torment is (so) severe.",
2598,"Among the people there is one who debates about Allah without knowledge, and follows every rebellious Satan,",
2599,"about whom it is destined that if someone takes him for friend, he will misguide him and lead him to the torment of the Fire.",
2600,"O mankind, if you are in doubt about Resurrection, then (recall that) We created you from dust, then from a drop of semen, then from a clot, then from a piece of flesh, either shaped or unshaped, so that We manifest (Our power) to you.We retain in the wombs whatever We will to a specified term. Then We bring you out as babies, then (We nourish you) so that you reach your maturity. And among you there is one who dies, and among you there is one who is carried to the worst part of the age, so that he knows nothing even after having knowledge.And you see the land dry. Then once We send down water on it, it stirs and swells and puts forth every pleasant pair (of vegetation).",
2601,"That is because Allah is the truth, and that He gives life to the dead, and that He is powerful to do everything,",
2602,"and that the Hour (of Doom) has to come, in which there is no doubt, and that Allah will raise again all those in the graves.",
2603,"Among men there is one who debates about Allah with no knowledge, no guidance and no enlightening book,",
2604,"turning his side away to lead (people) astray from the way of Allah. For him there is disgrace in this world, and We will have him taste the punishment of Fire on the Day of Judgment",
2605,"(and will say to him) “All this is due to what your hands sent ahead, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.”",
2606,"And among men there is one who worships Allah (standing) on the verge: so if some good thing happens to him, he is satisfied with it, and if a trial befalls him, he turns his face back. He loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is the manifest loss.",
2607,"He prays to someone, instead of Allah, who can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is the error that takes him too far from the right path.",
2608,"He, rather, prays to someone whose harm is more likely than his benefit. Wretched is such a patron and wretched is such a companion.",
2609,"Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds into gardens beneath which rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He intends.",
2610,"If someone thinks that Allah will never help him (the prophet) in this world and in the Hereafter, he should stretch a rope to the sky, then cut (Allah’s communication) off (from the prophet) and see whether his effort can really remove what irritates (him).",
2611,"And this is how We have sent it (the Qur’ān) down as clear signs, and the fact is that Allah leads whom He wills to the right path.",
2612,"As for those who believe and the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians and the Magians and those who ascribe partners to Allah, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment. Surely Allah is witness to every thing.",
2613,"Have you not seen that to Allah prostrate all those in the skies and all those on the earth, and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the animals and many from mankind? And there are many on whom punishment has become due. And the one whom Allah puts to disgrace, there is none to give him respect. Surely Allah does what He wills.",
2614,"These are two opponents who have disputed about their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments from fire shall be tailored for them, and boiling water shall be poured from over their heads",
2615,"whereby everything in their bellies, as well as the skins, will be melted.",
2616,And for them there are hooked rods of iron.,
2617,"Whenever, in their anguish, they will intend to come out of it (the fire), they will be turned back to it, and (it will be said to them,) “Taste the punishment of burning”.",
2618,"Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their dress therein will be (of) silk.",
2619,"Guided they were to the good word (of faith) and guided they were to the path of (Allah,) the Praised One.",
2620,"Surely (We will punish) those who disbelieve and prevent (people) from the way of Allah and from Al-Masjid-ul-Harām (the Sacred Mosque), which We have made for all men, where residents and visitors are all equal. And whoever intends therein to commit deviation with injustice, We will make him taste a painful punishment.",
2621,"And (remember) when We pointed out for Ibrāhīm the place of the House (of Allah) saying, “Do not associate anything with Me as My partner, and purify My House for those who make Tawāf (circumambulation around it), and those who perform Qiyām (standing up in worship) and those who perform Rukū‘ (bowing down) and Sujūd (prostration),",
2622,"and announce among people about (the obligation of) Hajj, so that they should come to you on foot, and on every camel turned lean, traveling through every distant hilly pathway,",
2623,"so that they witness benefits for them, and recite Allah’s name in specified days, over the provision He gave them from the cattle. “So, eat thereof and feed the distressed, the poor.”",
2624,"Then, they must remove their dirt, and fulfill their vows, and make Tawāf of the Ancient House.”",
2625,"Having said that, whoever observes reverence of the things sanctified by Allah, it is good for him with his Lord. And permitted to you are the cattle, except those mentioned to you through recitation (of the verses). So refrain from the filth of the idols and refrain from a word of falsehood,",
2626,"standing upright for (the obedience of) Allah, not ascribing any partner to Him. Whoever ascribes a partner to Allah, it is as if he falls down from the sky, and either the birds snatch him, or the wind drives him away to a far off place.",
2627,"Having said that, if one observes the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, then such things emanate from the piety of the hearts.",
2628,And for you there are benefits in them (the cattle) up to a specified time. Then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House.,
2629,"For every Ummah (religious community) We prescribed the act of sacrifice, so that they recite Allah’s name over the provision He gave them from the cattle. So, your God is One God. Therefore, to Him alone you must submit. And give good news to those who turn to Him with humbleness -",
2630,"those whose hearts are filled with awe when Allah is remembered, and who observe patience against whatever befalls them, and who are steadfast in Salāh, and who spend (in the way of Allah) out of what We have given to them.",
2631,"The big animals of sacrifice (like camels and cows) are made by Us among the symbols of Allah for you, in which there is much good for your benefit. So recite the name of Allah over them as they are lined up (for sacrifice). Then, once their flanks fall down (after slaughter), eat of them and feed the one who is content and the one who wishes to receive. Thus We have made them (the animals) subjugated to you, so that you may be grateful.",
2632,"It is neither their flesh nor their blood that reaches Allah, but what does reach Him is the taqwā (the sense of obedience) on your part. Thus He has made them (the animals) subjugated to you, so that you proclaim Allah’s glory for the guidance He gave you. And give good news to those who are good in their deeds.",
2633,"Surely, Allah defends those who believe. Allah does not love any treacherous, ungrateful.",
2634,"Permission (to fight) is given to those against whom fighting is launched, because they have been wronged, and Allah is powerful to give them victory.",
2635,"(They are) the ones who were expelled from their homes without any just reason, except that they say “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not been repelling some people by means of some others, the monasteries, the churches, the synagogues and the mosques where Allah’s name is abundantly recited would have been demolished. Allah will definitely help those who help Him (by defending the religion prescribed by Him.) Surely Allah is Powerful, Mighty.",
2636,"(The ones who help Allah are) those who, when We give them power in the land, establish Salāh, pay Zakāh, bid what is Fair and forbid what is Unfair. And with Allah lies the fate of all matters.",
2637,"And if they reject you, so did reject the people of NūH (Noah) and ‘Ād and Thamūd,",
2638,"and the people of Ibrāhīm and the people of LūT (Lot),",
2639,"and the people of Madyan as well. Mūsā was (also) rejected. So, I gave some respite to the disbelievers, then seized them. So how was My censure?",
2640,"How many towns have We destroyed, as they were wrongdoers! So, they are fallen down on their roofs, and (how many a) deserted well and (how many a) well-built castle!",
2641,"Have they not, then, traveled on earth so that they should have had hearts to understand with, or ears to listen with? The fact is that it is not the eyes that turn blind, but what turns blind is the hearts contained in the chests.",
2642,"They ask you to bring the punishment sooner, while Allah will never go back on His promise. In fact, one day with your Lord is like one thousand years according to your calculation.",
2643,"And how many towns were there to whom I allowed respite, while they were wrongdoers, then I seized them. And to Me is the final return.",
2644,"Say, “O people, I am no more than a plain warner for you.",
2645,"So those who come to believe and do good deeds, for them there is forgiveness and dignified provision.",
2646,"As for those who strive against Our signs, trying to defeat (the prophet or the believers), they are the people of the Fire.”",
2647,"We did not send any messenger before you nor a prophet, but (he faced a situation that) when he recited (the revelation), the Satan cast (doubts in the hearts of his opponents) about what he recited.

2648,"(All this is allowed to be done) so that He may make what Satan casts a trial for those in whose hearts there is a disease, and whose hearts are hard;-and surely the wrongdoers are in the utmost antagonism-",
2649,"and so that those who have been given knowledge may know that it (i.e. the revelation recited by the prophet) is the truth from your Lord, and they may believe in it and their hearts may become humble towards it. Allah is the Guide of the believers to the straight path.",
2650,"Those who disbelieve will remain in doubt about it (the Qur’ān) forever, until the Hour (of Judgment) comes upon them suddenly, or there comes to them the punishment of a barren day.",
2651,"The kingdom, on that day, is for Allah. He will judge between them. So, those who believed and did good deeds shall be in gardens of bliss.",
2652,"As for those who disbelieved and rejected Our signs, they are the ones for whom there is a humiliating punishment.",

2654,"He will definitely admit them to an entrance they will be pleased with, and Allah is surely All-Knowing, Forbearing.",
2655,"Having said this, whoever afflicts (someone) with a punishment equal to what he was afflicted with (by the latter), and still he (the former) is (again) subjected to aggression (by the latter), Allah will certainly help him. Indeed, Allah is Most-Pardoning, Most-Forgiving.",
2656,"That is because Allah makes night enter into the day and makes day enter into the night and that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",
2657,"That is because Allah is the truth and that whatever they invoke beside Him is false and that Allah is the High, the Great.",
2658,"Did you not see that Allah has sent down water from the sky, whereby the land becomes green? Surely, Allah is All-Kind, All-Aware.",
2659,"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and surely Allah is the All-Independent, Ever-Praised.",
2660,"Did you not see that Allah has subjugated to you everything on the earth, and the ships that sail at sea with His command? And He holds the sky so as it cannot fall on the earth except with His permission. Surely Allah is Very-Kind to the people, Very-Merciful.",

2662,"For every Ummah (religious community) We have appointed a way of worship they are to observe. Therefore, they should never quarrel with you in the matter. And do call (them) to your Lord. Surely, you are on straight Guidance.",
2663,"And if they dispute with you, say (to them), “Allah is the best aware of what you do.”",
2664,"Allah will judge between you, on the Day of Judgment, about what you used to dispute.",
2665,"Do you not know that Allah knows all that is in the sky and the earth? Surely, that is contained in a Book. Indeed it is so easy for Allah.",
2666,"They worship, besides Allah, the objects for which He did never send down an authority (or proof) and about which they have no knowledge. And for the wrongdoers there is no helper.",
2667,"When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, you (can) recognize disgust on the faces of the disbelievers. They seem to attack those who recite to them Our verses. Say, “Shall I, then, tell you about something more disgusting than that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve. And it is an evil end.”",
2668,"O people, here is a parable set forth to you, so listen to it carefully: All those whom you invoke besides Allah can never create (even) a fly, even though they all join hands together for that. And if a fly snatches something away from them, they cannot release it from its possession. (Equally) feeble are the invoker and the invoked.",
2669,"They did not recognize Allah in His true esteem. Indeed Allah is Powerful, Mighty.",

So establish Salāh, pay Zakāh and hold fast to Allah. He is your patron. So, how excellent He is as a patron, and how excellent as a supporter!",
2674,Success is really attained by the believers,
2675,who concentrate their attention in humbleness when offering Salāh (prayers),

2682,and who consistently observe their prayers.,
2683,Those are the inheritors,
2684,who will inherit Firdaus (the Paradise). They will be there forever.,
2685,We have created man from an extract of clay.,

2689,Then you are to be raised again on the Day of Judgment.,
2690,"And We created above you seven paths (heavens), and We were never neglectful of the creation.",
2691,"And We sent down water from the sky in due measure, then We lodged it in the earth, and of course, We are able to take it away.",
2692,"Then We produced with it gardens of date-palms and vines for your benefit. For you there are many fruits in them, and of them you eat",
2693,"- and (We produced) a tree (of olive) that comes forth from the (mount) Tūr of Sinai, which grows with oil and with a dressing for those who eat.",
2694,"And indeed there is a sure lesson in the cattle for you. We give you a drink from that which lies in their bellies, and for you there are many benefits in them, and of them you eat,",
2695,and on them and on the boats you are transported.,
2696,"Surely, We sent NūH to his nation. So he said, “My people, worship Allah. You have no god whatsoever other than Him. So, do you not fear Allah?”",
2697,"So, said the disbelieving chiefs from among his nation, “This (man) is nothing but a human being like you. He wishes to impose his superiority over you. Had Allah willed, He would have sent down angels (instead of him). We have not heard of such a thing among our forefathers.",
2698,He is none but a man suffering from madness; so wait for (what happens to) him until some time”,
2699,"He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have rejected me.”",
2700,"So, We sent Our revelation to him, saying, “Make the ship under Our eyes and Our revelation.

And do not speak to Me (in favor) of those who have done wrong. They are sure to be drowned.",
2701,"So, when you and those with you are well seated in the ship, say, ‘Praise is for Allah who saved us from the wrongdoing people.’",
2702,"And say, ‘My Lord, make me land a blessed landing, and You are the best of those who bring (someone) to land’”.",
2703,"Surely, there are signs in it, and We do always test (people).",
2704,"Then after them We created another generation,",
2705,and sent among them a messenger from themselves (to convey the message): “Worship Allah; you have no god whatsoever other than Him. So do you not fear Allah?”,
2706,"Then said the chiefs of his nation who were disbelievers and who denied facing the Hereafter and whom We made affluent in the worldly life, “This (man) is nothing but a human being. He eats from what you eat from, and drinks from what you drink.",
2707,"If you obey a human like yourselves, then you will be absolute losers.",
2708,"Does he promise you that, when you die and are turned into dust and bones, you are to be brought forth?",
2709,Far too improbable is what you are being promised.,

2715,"Then, after them, We created another generation.",
2716,"No community can go ahead of its appointed time, nor can they become late.",
2717,"Thereafter, We sent Our messengers successively. Whenever its messenger came to a community, they rejected him. Then We made some of them follow others (in destruction) and turned them into tales (of history). So, away with a people who do not believe.",
2718,"Thereafter, We sent Mūsā and his brother Hārūn with Our signs and a clear proof",
2719,towards Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his advisors. But they showed arrogance and they were haughty people.,
2720,"So they said, “shall we believe in two humans who are like ourselves and whose people are serving us as slaves?”",
2721,Thus they rejected both of them and were among the destroyed.,
2722,"And, of course, We gave Mūsā the Book, so that they may take the right path.",
2723,"And We made the son of Maryam (Mary) and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on a height, having a place of rest and running springs.",
2724,"O messengers, eat from the good things, and act righteously. Of whatever you do, I am fully aware.",
2725,"Surely, this is your creed, a single creed, and I am your Lord. So fear Me.",
2726,"But they split up ways from one another (dividing themselves) into factions, each faction happy with what lies before it.",

2735,"We do not place a burden on anyone except according to his ability. With Us there is a book which speaks with truth, and they shall not be wronged.",
2736,"But their hearts are in ignorance about this, and they have deeds, other than that, which they are continuously doing.",
2737,"Until when We will seize their affluent ones with punishment, they will suddenly start crying.",
2738,"(Then it will be said to them,) “Do not cry today. You will not be helped by Us.",
2739,"My verses used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels",
2740,"in arrogance, making it a subject of tales at night, talking nonsense (about it).”",
2741,"Then, is it that they did not ponder over the Word (of Allah), or there has come to them something that did not come to their forefathers?",
2742,Or did they not recognize their messenger and therefore they denied him?,

3174,"Surely We gave knowledge to Dāwūd and Sulaimān, and they said, “Praise belongs to Allah who made us excel many of His believing servants.",
3175,"And Sulaimān inherited (the traits of) Dāwūd and said, “O people we have been taught the speech of birds, and all sorts of things are given to us. Indeed, this is the evident grace (of Allah).”",
3176,"And mustered for Sulaimān were his forces from among the Jinns and the humans and the birds. So all of them were kept under (his) control,",
3177,"until when they reached the valley of the ants, one of the ants said, “O ants, enter your dwelling places, lest Sulaimān and his armies crush you unknowingly.”",
3178,"So he (Sulaimān) smiled, laughing on her speech and said, “My Lord, enable me to become grateful to Your favor that you have bestowed on me and on my parents, and to do good deeds that You like, and admit me, with Your mercy, among Your righteous servants.”",
3179,"And (once) he (Sulaimān) checked the birds and said, “How is it with me that I do not see the hudhud (hoopoe)? Rather he has disappeared.",
3180,I will punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings to me a clear plea.”,
3181,"Then the hoopoe did not take long and said (to Sulaimān), “I have discovered what you did not, and have brought to you a sure information from Saba’ (Sheba).",
3182,"I have found a woman ruling over them, and all sorts of things are given to her, and she has a great throne.",
3183,"I have found her and her people prostrating themselves to the sun, instead of Allah, and the Satan has beautified their deeds for them, and has prevented them from the way, so they do not take the right path,",
3184,"that is, they do not prostrate to Allah who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth,-and who knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal.”",
3185,"Allah! There is no god but He, the Lord of the Great Throne.",
3186,"He (Sulaimān) said, “We shall see whether you have told the truth or you are one of the liars.",
3187,"Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it down to them, then turn back from them, and see how they react.”",
3188,"She (the queen) said (to her officials after receiving the letter), “O chieftains, there has been delivered to me an esteemed letter.",

3190,"Do not rebel against me, and come to me in submission.”",
3191,"She said, “O chieftains, advise me in the matter I have (before me). I am not the one who decides a matter absolutely unless you are present with me.”",
3192,"They said, “We are powerful and tough fighters, and the decision lies with you; so consider what command you should give.”",
3193,"She said, “In fact when the kings enter a town, they put it to disorder, and put its honorable citizens to disgrace, and this is how they normally do.",
3194,"And I am going to send a gift to them, then see, what response the envoys will bring back.”",
3195,"So when he (the envoy) came to Sulaimān, he said, “Are you extending a financial aid to me? So what Allah has given me is much better than what He has given to you. But you yourselves are proud of your gift.",
3196,"Go back to them, and we will bring to them forces they have no power to face, and we will certainly drive them out from there in humiliation while they are disgraced.”",
3197,"He said, “O chieftains, which one of you will bring her throne to me before they come to me submissively?”",
3198,"A stalwart of the Jinn said, “I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place, and for this (task) I am powerful, reliable.”",
3199,"Said the one who had the knowledge of the book, “I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.” So when he saw it (the throne) well placed before him, he said, “This is by the grace of my Lord, so that He may test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Need-Free, Bountiful”.",
3200,"He said, “Disguise the throne for her, and we will see whether she discovers the truth, or she does not recognize it.”",
3201,"So when she came, it was said (to her), “Is your throne like this?” She said, “It seems to be the same. We have been made to recognize the truth even before this, and we have already submitted.”",
3202,And she was prevented (from submitting before this) by that which she used to worship instead of Allah. Indeed she was from a disbelieving people.,
3203,"It was said to her, “Enter the palace.” Then once she saw it, she thought it was flowing water, and uncovered her legs. He (Sulaimān) said, “This is a palace made of glasses.” She said, “My Lord, I had surely wronged myself, and now I submit, along with Sulaimān, to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.”",
3204,"And We sent to Thamūd their brother SāliH saying (to them), “Worship Allah”. Then suddenly they became two groups quarrelling with each other.",
3205,"He said, “My people, why do you seek evil to come sooner before good? Why do you not seek forgiveness from Allah, so that you are treated with mercy?”",
3206,"They said, “We regard you and those with you as a sign of bad omen.” He said, “Your omen is with Allah, but you are a people put to a test.”",
3207,And there were nine persons in the city who used to make mischief on the earth and did not put things right.,
3208,"They said, “Let us swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall attack him (SāliH) and his family at night, then will say to his heir, ‘We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are really truthful.’”",
3209,"Thus they devised a plan, and We devised a plan, while they were not aware.",
3210,"So, look how was the fate of their plan, that We annihilated them and their people altogether.",
3211,"Now those are their houses, lying empty because of their transgression. Surely, in this there are signs for a people who have knowledge.",
3212,And We saved those who believed and who used to be God-fearing.,
3213,"And (We sent) LūT when he said to his people, “Do you commit the shameful act while you can see (its shamefulness)?",

3215,"So, the answer of his people was not else but that they said, “Expel the family of LūT from your town. They are a people who over-indulge in purity.”",
3216,"So, We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to remain among those who stayed behind.",
3217,And We rained on them a rain. So evil was the rain of those who were warned.,
3218,"Say, “Praise belongs to Allah, and peace be on those of His servants whom He has chosen.” Is Allah better or that which they associate (with Him as His partners)?",
3219,"Or the One who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you water from the sky? Then We caused to grow with it gardens, full of glamour. It was not within your ability to grow their trees. Is there any god along with Allah? No, but they are a people who equate (others with Allah).",
3220,"Or the One who made the earth a place to settle and made rivers amidst it and made mountains for (making) it (firm), and made a barrier between two seas? Is there any god along with Allah? No, but most of them do not have knowledge.",

3253,Tā Sīn Mīm.,
3254,These are verses of the clear Book.,
3255,We recite to you a part of the story of Mūsā and Pharaoh with truth for a people who believe.,
3256,"Indeed, Pharaoh had become high-handed in the land, and had divided its people into different groups; he used to persecute a group of them, slaughtering their sons and keeping their women alive. Indeed he was one of the mischief-makers,",
3257,"while We intended to favor those who were held as weak in the land, and to make them leaders and make them inheritors,",
3258,"and give them power in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Hāmān and their armies the very thing they were fearing from them.",
3259,"We inspired the mother of Mūsā saying, “Suckle him (Mūsā). Then once you fear about him, cast him in the river, and do not fear, and do not grieve. Surely We are going to bring him back to you and appoint him one of (Our) messengers.”",
3260,"So the family of Pharaoh picked him up, so that he becomes for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief. Indeed Pharaoh, Hāmān and their armies were mistaken.",
3261,"And the wife of Pharaoh said, (to Pharaoh about Mūsā), “He may be a delight of eye for me and you. Do not kill him. It is hoped that he will be of benefit to us, or we will adopt him as a son.” And they were not aware (of what was going to happen).",
3262,"And the heart of the mother of Mūsā became restless; indeed she was about to disclose this (the real facts about Mūsā), had We not strengthened her heart to remain among those who have firm belief (in Allah’s promise).",
3263,"She said to his sister, “Keep track of him.” So she watched him from a distance, while they were not aware.",
3264,"And We had already barred him (Mūsā) from (accepting) any suckling women, so she (his sister) said (to Pharaoh’s people), “Shall I point out to you a family who will nurse him for you, and they will be his well-wishers?”",
3265,"Thus We brought him back to his mother, so that her eye might have comfort and she might not grieve, and so that she might know that Allah’s promise is true, but most of them do not know.",
3266,"And when he reached his maturity and became perfect, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.",
3267,"Once he entered the city at a time when its people were heedless; so he found in it two men fighting each other: This one was from his own group, and that one from his enemies. So the one from his own group called him for help against the one who was from his enemies. So Mūsā gave him a blow with his fist and finished him off. (Then) He (Mūsā) said (out of remorse), “This is some of Satan’s act. He is indeed a clear enemy who misleads (people).”",
3268,"He said, “O my Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.” So He forgave him. Indeed He is the most Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
3269,"He (Mūsā) said, “O my Lord! As You have favored me, I will never be a supporter of the sinners.”",
3270,"Then next morning he was fearful in the city, waiting (for what comes next) when the man who sought his help the day before, shouted to him for help (again). Mūsā said to him, “You are surely a clear trouble-maker.”",
3271,"Thereafter when he intended to grasp at the one who was an enemy to both of them, he (i.e. the Israelite) said, “O Mūsā, do you want to kill me as you have killed a person yesterday? Your intention is only to become a tyrant in the land, and you do not intend to be one of the peace-makers.”",
3272,"And there came a man running from the farthest part of the city. He said, “The chiefs are counseling each other about you, so that they kill you. So, leave (the city). I am one of your well-wishers.”",
3273,"So, he went out of it (the city), looking around in a state of fear. He said, “O my Lord, save me from the cruel people.”",
3274,"When he set out towards Madyan, he said, “I hope my Lord will guide me to the straight path”.",
3275,"And when he arrived at the waters of Madyan, he found a large number of people watering (their animals) and found, aloof from them, two women keeping (their animals) back. He said, “What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water (our animals) until these shepherds take (their animals) back after watering them, and our father is very old man.”",
3276,"So he (Mūsā) watered (their animals) for them, then he turned to a shade and said, “My Lord, I am in need of whatever good you send down to me.”",
3277,"Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is calling you, so that he may give you a reward for watering our animals. So when he (Mūsā) came to him (the father of the women) and narrated to him the whole story, the latter said, “Do not fear; you have escaped from the wrongdoing people.”",
3278,"One of the two women said, “Dear father, hire him; the best man you can hire is someone who is strong, trustworthy.”",
3279,"He (the father) said (to Mūsā), “I wish to marry to you one of these two daughters of mine on condition that you act as my employee for eight years. Then if you complete ten (years) it will be of your own accord. And I do not want to put you in any trouble; you will find me, Inshā’allah (God-willing) one of the righteous.”",
3280,"He (Mūsā) said, “This is (done) between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there should be no excess against me, and Allah is witness to what we are saying.”",
3281,"So, when Mūsā completed the term and set forth with his wife, he noticed a fire from the direction of (the mount) Tūr, he said to his wife, “Stay here; I have noticed a fire. May be I bring to you some information or an ember from the fire, so that you may warm yourself.”",
3282,"So when he came to it, he was called by a voice coming from a side of the right valley in the blessed ground, from the tree, saying, “O Mūsā, I AM ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds,”",
3283,"and saying, “Throw down your staff.” So when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned back in retreat, and did not look back. (Allah said to him), “O Mūsā come forward and do not fear; you are one of those in peace.",
3284,"Insert your hand into your bosom, and it will come out white without any evil (disease), and press your arm to your side for (removing) fear. Thus these are two proofs from your Lord (sent) to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Indeed they are transgressing people.”",
3285,"He said, “My Lord, I have killed a person from them, therefore I fear that they will kill me.",
3286,"And my brother Hārūn is more eloquent than me in speech; so send him with me as a helper to bear me out. I am afraid, they will give the lie to me.”",
3287,"He (Allah) said, “We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and will give both of you such a power that they will have no access to you (to cause any harm) because of Our signs. You and your followers will be the victors.”",
3288,"So when Mūsā came to them with Our clear signs, they said, “This is nothing but a forged magic, and we have never heard of such a thing happening in the days of our forefathers.”",
3289,"Mūsā said, “My Lord is best aware of the one who has brought guidance from Him and who is going to meet the best end of the abode. It is certain that the wrongdoers will not succeed.”",
3290,"And Pharaoh said (to his people,) “O courtiers, I do not recognize any god for you other than me. So kindle for me, O Hāmān, a fire on the clay (to bake bricks) and build for me a tower, so that I may look on to the God of Mūsā. I deem him to be one of the liars.”",
3291,(Thus) he and his hosts showed arrogance in the land with no justification and thought that they would not be returned to Us.,
3292,"So We seized him and his hosts and threw them into the sea. Look then, how was the fate of the wrongdoers.",
3293,"We made them leaders who called (people) towards hell; and on the Day of Judgment, they will not be helped.",
3294,And We made a curse to pursue them in this world; and on the Day of Judgment they will be among those dejected.,
3295,"And We gave Mūsā, after We destroyed the earlier generations, the Book having insights for people and a guidance and mercy, so that they may receive the advice.",
3296,"And (O prophet,) you were not there at the Western side (of the mount Tūr) when We delegated the matter to Mūsā, nor were you among those present,",
3297,"but We created generations (after him) and a long time passed over them. And you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting Our verses to them, but it is We who do send messengers.",
3298,"And you were not at the side of (the mount) Tūr when We called (Mūsā), but it (your prophet-hood through which you knew all this) is a mercy from your Lord, so that you warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, that they may receive the advice.",
3299,"And (We have sent you as a messenger) lest, in case they suffered a calamity because of what their hands sent ahead, they should say, “Our Lord, why did You not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed your verses and been among the believers?”",
3300,"But when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why has he (the messenger) not been given (a book) similar to what Mūsā had been given?” Is it not that they denied what Mūsā had been given before? They said, “Both (Qur’ān and Torah) are works of magic that support each other.” And they said, “We disbelieve each one of them.”",
3301,"Say, “Then bring a book from Allah which is better than both, in guidance, and I shall follow it, if you are true.”",
3302,"So if they do not respond to you, be sure that they are only following their desires. And who is more astray than the one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah. Surely Allah does not take the wrongdoing people onto the right path.",
3303,"And We have conveyed (Our) word to them one after the other, so that they may receive the advice.",
3304,"As for those to whom We gave the Book before this, they believe in it (Qur’ān).",
3305,"And when this (Qur’ān) is recited to them, they say, “We believe in it. It is the truth from our Lord, and we are the ones who had submitted (to it) even before it (was revealed).”",
3306,"Such people will be given their reward twice, because they observed patience. And they repel evil with good, and spend from what We have given to them.",
3307,"And when they hear absurd talk, they withdraw from it and say, “Our deeds are for us and your deeds are for you. Peace be on you. We do not desire (to be entangled with) the ignorant people.”",
3308,"You cannot give guidance to whomsoever you wish, but Allah gives guidance to whomsoever He wills, and He best knows the ones who are on the right path.",
3309,"They said, “If we follow the guidance with you (O Muhammad), we will be driven out of our land.” Is it not that We have established them in the peaceful Haram (sanctuary) to which the fruits of everything are drawn as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know.",
3310,"And how many a town have We destroyed that were over-proud of their means of living. Now, those are their habitations, which were never inhabited after them except a few, and We alone were the inheritors.",
3311,"And your Lord is not such as He would destroy the towns unless he had sent to their central place a messenger who recites to them Our verses, nor are We such as would destroy the towns unless their people are wrongdoers.",
3312,"Moreover, whatever of anything you are given is (no more than) an enjoyment of the worldly life and its decoration, and that which lies with Allah is much better and far more lasting. So do you not use reason?",
3313,"Is then the one, to whom We have made a good promise which he is going to meet, like the one whom We have given the benefit of enjoying the worldly life, then on the Day of Judgment he will be among those arraigned?",
3314,"(Remember) the Day when He will call them and say, “Where are My ‘partners’ you used to claim?",
3315,"Those against whom the word will come true will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray. We led them astray as we ourselves went astray. We negate before you our responsibility (in respect of them); it was not we whom they worshipped.”",
3316,"And it will be said, “Call those whom you held as co-gods.” So they will call them, but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. Would that they had taken the right path!",
3317,"(Remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them and say, “What response did you give to the messengers?”",
3318,"So all events will become too obscure for them (to give a correct reply), and they will not (be able to) consult each other.",
3319,"As for the one who repents and becomes a believer and acts righteously, hopefully he will be among the successful.",
3320,Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. Choice is not theirs. Pure is Allah and far higher than their ascribing of partners to Him.,
3321,Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal.,
3322,"And He is Allah. There is no god but He. Praise is only for Him in the beginning and at the end, and He alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned.",
3323,"Say, “Tell me, if Allah were to impose the night over you, continuing forever up to the Day of Judgment, which god, other than Allah, would bring to you light? Then, do you not listen?”",
3324,"Say, “Tell me, if Allah were to impose the day over you, continuing for ever up to the Day of Judgment, which god, other than Allah, would bring to you night in which you may have rest? Then, do you not see?”",
3325,"And it is out of His mercy that He has made day and night for you, so that you may have rest in it, and so that you may search for His grace, and so that you may be grateful.",
3326,"And (remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them (the disbelievers) and say, “Where are My ‘partners’ you used to claim?”",
3327,"And We will draw out a witness from every community (to prove their disbelief) and will say, “Bring your proof”. Then they will know that truth is from Allah, and all that they used to forge shall vanish from them.",
3328,"Indeed Qārūn was from the people of Mūsā, then he rebelled against them. And We had given to him such treasures as their keys would weigh too heavy for a strong group of people. (Remember) when his people said to him, “Do not exult. Surely, Allah does not like the exultant.",
3329,"And seek the (betterment of) the Ultimate Abode with what Allah has given to you, and do not neglect your share from this world, and do good as Allah did good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land. Surely, Allah does not like the mischief-makers.”",
3330,"He said, “This is given to me because of the knowledge (I have) with me.” Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, from the generations before him, those who were stronger than him in power and greater than him in multitude? And the sinners have not to be asked about their sins.",
3331,"Then (once) he came out before his people in his embellishment. Said those who are desirous of the worldly life, “Would that we had the like of what Qārūn has been given! He is a man of great fortune indeed.”",
3332,"And said those who were given knowledge, “Woe to you, Allah’s reward is much better for him who believes and acts righteously. But this is given to none but to those who observe restraint.”",
3333,"Then We made him and his home sink into the earth. So there was no group for him who could help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could defend themselves.",
3334,"And those who wished to be in his position the day before, started saying, “Oh, it seems that Allah extends provision to whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Had Allah not favored us, He would have made us sink (too). Oh, it seems that the infidels do not succeed.”",
3335,"As for that Ultimate Abode (the Hereafter), We assign it to those who do not intend haughtiness on earth nor mischief. And the (best) end is for the God-fearing.",
3336,"Whoever brings good deed shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil deed, then those who commit evils shall not be punished except for what they used to do.",
3337,"Surely the One who has enjoined the Qur’ān upon you will surely bring you back to a place of return. Say, “My Lord best knows the one who has come with guidance and the one who is in manifest error.”",
3338,"You were not expecting that the Book would be sent down to you, but it was a mercy from your Lord. So, never be a supporter for the infidels.",
3339,"And let them not prevent you from Allah’s verses after they are sent down to you, and call (people) to your Lord, and never become one of those who associate partners with Allah.",
3340,"And do not invoke any other god along with Allah. There is no god but He. Every thing is going to perish except His Face. He alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned.",
3341,"Alif , Lām , Mīm .",
3342,"Do people think that they will be left (at ease) only on their saying, “We believe” and will not be put to any test?",
3343,"Indeed We have tested those who were before them. So Allah will surely know the ones who are truthful, and He will surely know the liars.",
3344,Or do those who commit evils think that they will outstrip Us? Evil is what they predicate.,
3345,"Whoever hopes to meet Allah (must be sure that) Allah’s appointed time has to come, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
3346,"Whoever strives, strives for his own benefit. Surely Allah is independent of all the worlds.",
3347,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will expiate their bad deeds and will give them a better reward (than their expectation) for what they used to do.",
3348,"We have instructed man to do good to his parents. And if they insist upon you that you should ascribe partners to Me, then do not obey them. To Me is your return; then I shall tell you what you used to do.",
3349,"And those who believe and do righteous deeds, We shall include them among the righteous.",
3350,"Among men there are those who say, “We believe in Allah”, but when they are persecuted in (the way of) Allah, they take the persecution of men, as equal to the punishment of Allah. And should any help come from your Lord, they will certainly say, “We were with you.” Is it not that Allah knows well what lies in the hearts of the people of all the worlds?",
3351,Allah will certainly know those who believe and He will certainly know the hypocrites.,
3352,"Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Follow our way, and we will bear the burden of your sins.” And they are not (able) to bear the burden of their sins in the least. Indeed they are pure liars.",
3353,"They shall certainly bear their own loads, and some other loads along with their own loads, and they will certainly be questioned about what they used to forge.",
3354,"We sent NūH to his people. So he stayed with them one thousand, less fifty, years. Then the Deluge seized them, and they were transgressors.",
3355,"So We saved him and the people of the Ark, and made it a sign for all the worlds.",
3356,"And (We sent) Ibrāhīm when he said to his people, “Worship Allah and fear Him. That is better for you if you know.",
3357,"You only worship idols beside Allah, and you invent a lie. In fact those whom you worship beside Allah do not have power to give you provision. So seek provision with Allah and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you are to be returned.",
3358,"And if you reject me, then many nations have rejected their messengers before you. The messenger has no more obligation than to convey the message clearly.”",
3359,"Did they not see how Allah originates the creation, then He will do it again. Surely this is easy for Allah.",
3360,"Say, “Go about in the land and look how He has originated the creation. Then Allah will create the subsequent creation. Surely Allah is powerful to do everything.”",
3361,He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He wills. And to Him you are to be turned back.,
3362,"You are not (able) to frustrate (Allah) neither in the earth nor in the sky. And, apart from Allah, you have neither a protector nor a helper.",
3363,"And those who deny the signs of Allah and meeting with Him - those will despair of My mercy, and those are the ones for whom there is a painful punishment.",
3364,"So, the response of his (Ibrāhīm) people was none but that they said, “Kill him” or “Burn him”. So Allah saved him from the fire. Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe.",
3365,"And he (Ibrāhīm) said, “You have adopted idols instead of Allah, only because of love (you have) with each other in the worldly life. Then on the Day of Judgment you will reject each other, and will curse each other. And your abode is the Fire, and you will have no helpers.”",
3366,"So LūT believed in him, and he (Ibrāhīm) said, “I am going to leave my homeland towards my Lord. Surely He is the Mighty, the Wise.",
3367,"And We granted him IsHāq (Isaac) and Ya‘qūb (Jacob), and assigned prophet-hood and Book to his progeny, and gave him his reward in the world; and of course, in the Hereafter, he will be one of the righteous.",
3368,"And (We sent) LūT when he said to his people, “Indeed you commit the shameful act that no one in the worlds has ever preceded you in it.",
3369,"Is it (not) a fact that you go for men (to satisfy your lust) and rob the wayfarers and commit evil in your gathering?” So the answer of his people was none but that they said, “Bring us Allah’s punishment, if you are one of the truthful.”",
3370,"He said, “My Lord, help me against the people who make mischief.”",
3371,"And when Our messengers came to Ibrāhīm with the good news, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this town. Surely its people have been transgressors.”",
3372,"He said, “There is LūT in it.” They said, “We know well who is in it. We will certainly save him and his family except his wife who will be among those remaining behind.”",
3373,"And when Our messengers came to LūT, he grieved for them and his heart was straitened because of them, but they said, “We are going to save you and your family, except your wife who will be among those remaining behind.",
3374,"We are going to bring down on the people of this town a punishment from the sky, because they used to act sinfully.”",
3375,And We left from it (the town) an evident sign for a people who understand.,
3376,"And (We sent) to Madyan their brother Shu‘aib. So he said, “O my people, worship Allah and fear the Last Day, and do not roam about in the land as mischief makers.”",
3377,"So they gave the lie to him, then they were seized by the earthquake and they remained in their homes lying on their faces.",
3378,"And (We destroyed) ‘Ād and Thamūd, and it is visible to you through their dwellings. And the Satan had beautified for them their deeds, so he prevented them from the (right) way, even though they were people of insight.",
3379,"And (We also destroyed) Qārūn and Pharaoh and Hāmān. Indeed Mūsā came to them with clear signs; so they acted arrogantly on the earth, and were not (able) to escape.",
3380,"Thus We seized each one of them for his sin. So to some of them We sent a violent wind; and some of them were seized by a Cry; and some of them We made to sink in the earth; and some of them We drowned. And Allah was not to do injustice to them, but they used to do injustice to their own selves.",
3381,"The example of those who have adopted patrons other than Allah is like the spider that has made a house, while indeed the weakest of houses is the house of the spider. If only they know.",
3382,"Surely, Allah knows whatever thing they invoke beside Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.",

3386,"Do not debate with the people of the Book unless it is in the best manner, except with those of them who commit injustice. And say, “We believe in what is sent down to us and sent down to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we submit (ourselves).”",
3387,"Thus We have sent down the Book to you. So those to whom We have given the Book believe in it. And from these (the people of Makkah) there are ones who believe in it, and no one rejects Our verses except the infidels.",
3388,"You (O Prophet,) have never been reciting any book before this, nor have you been writing it with your right hand; had it been so, the adherents of falsehood would have raised doubts.",
3389,But it (the Qur’ān in itself) is (a package of) evident signs in the hearts of those who are given knowledge. And no one rejects our verses except the wrongdoers.,
3390,"And they say, “Why is it that no signs (miracles) have been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “Signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.”",

3393,"They ask you to bring the punishment soon. Had there not been an appointed time, the punishment would have come to them. It will surely come to them suddenly while they will not be aware.",
3394,"They ask you to bring the punishment soon, while the Jahannam is surely going to engulf the disbelievers",
3395,"on the Day when the punishment will envelop them from above them and from under their feet and He (Allah) will say, “Taste what you used to do.”",

3406,"thus becoming ungrateful for what We gave to them. Let them have some enjoyment, then they will soon come to know (the ill-fate of their attitude).",
3407,Did they not see that We have made a peaceful sanctuary (Haram ) while (other) people around them are being snatched away? Do they still believe in falsity and reject Allah’s grace?,
3408,Who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Jahannam a home for disbelievers?,

3416,"They know something superficial of the worldly life, but of the Hereafter they are negligent.",
3417,Did they not reflect in their own selves? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them but with a just cause and for an appointed time. Yet many of the people are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.,
3418,"Have they not traveled on earth to see how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they had tilled the land and had made it more populous than these have made it, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs. So Allah was not such as could do injustice to them, but they used to do injustice to themselves.",

3422,"They will have no intercessors from among their (so-called) ‘partners of Allah’, and they themselves will reject their (such) ‘partners’.",
3423,And the day when the Hour (Qiyāmah : the Day of Judgement)) will take place-it will be on that day that they will turn into separate groups.,
3424,"Then, those who had believed and had done righteous deeds-they will be in a garden, extremely delighted.",
3425,"As for those who had disbelieved and rejected Our verses and the meeting of the Hereafter, they will be brought for punishment.",

3437,"He (Allah) gives you an example from yourselves: Do you have, from among your slaves, any partners in the wealth that We have given to you, so as they and you are equal in it, (and) so as you fear them like you fear each other? This is how We explain the signs for a people who understand.",
3438,But the wrongdoers have followed their desires without knowledge. So who can guide the one whom Allah leaves astray? For such people there are no helpers.,
3439,"So, set your face to the Faith uprightly, this (faith) being the nature designed by Allah on which He has created the mankind. There is no change in Allah’s creation. That is the straight faith, but most of the people do not know.",
3440,"(Set your face to the Faith) turning totally towards Him, and fear Him, and establish Salāh, and do not be among those who associate partners with Allah",
3441,- among those who split up their religion and became sects. Each group is happy with what it has before it.,
3442,"When the people are visited by some affliction, they invoke their Lord with exclusive concentration on Him. Then once He gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them starts at once ascribing partners to their Lord,",
3443,so as to become ungrateful for what We gave to them. So enjoy yourselves awhile; then you will soon come to know.,
3444,Is it that We have sent down to them any authority that speaks to them about their associating partners with Him?,
3445,"When We give people a taste of mercy, they are happy with it, and if they are touched by an evil because of what their hands sent ahead, they are at once in despair.",
3446,"Did they not see that Allah extends provision to whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills)? Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe.",
3447,"So give to the kinsman his right, and to the needy and the wayfarer. That is better for those who seek Allah’s pleasure, and it is they who will be successful.",
3448,"Whatever Ribā (increased amount) you give, so that it may increase in the wealth of the people, it does not increase with Allah; and whatever Zakāh you give, seeking Allah’s pleasure with it, (it is multiplied by Allah, and) it is such people who multiply (their wealth in real terms.)",
3449,"Allah is the One who created you, then gave sustenance to you, then He will make you dead, then He will make you alive. Is there any one from your (so-called) ‘partners of God’ who can do anything of that (kind)? Pure is He, and far higher than what they associate (with Him).",
3450,"Calamities have appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of the people have earned, so that He (Allah) makes them taste some of what they did, in order that they may return (to the right way).",
3451,"Say, “Go about in the land, and see how was the end of those who were before. Most of them were Mushriks (i.e. those who ascribe partners to Allah)”.",
3452,Then set your face to the straight Faith before the arrival of a day that will never be repulsed by Allah. On that Day the people will be split apart.,
3453,"Whoever disbelieves, his unbelief will be against him; and whoever acts righteously, then such people are paving the path for themselves,",
3454,"so that Allah may give reward, out of His grace, to those who believed and did righteous deeds. Surely He does not love the unbelievers.",
3455,"And among His signs is that He sends winds giving good news (of rain), and so that He gives you a taste of His mercy, and that the ships may sail with His command, and that you may search for His grace, and you may be grateful.",
3456,We had indeed sent before you messengers to their people. So they came to them with clear proofs. Then We took vengeance upon those who were guilty; and it was due on Us to help the believers.,
3457,"Allah is the One who sends the winds, so they stir up a cloud, then He spreads it in the sky however He wills, and makes it (split) into pieces. Then you see the rain coming out from its midst. So, once He makes it reach those whom He wills from His slaves, they start rejoicing,",
3458,even though they were absolutely hopeless before it was sent down to them.,
3459,"So, look to the effects of Allah’s mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death. Surely, That (Allah) is the One who will give life to the dead; and He has the power to do everything.",
3460,"Should We send a (harmful) wind, and they see it (the tillage) turning yellow, then they will turn ungrateful, even after all the aforesaid (bounties of Allah).",
3461,"So, you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they turn their backs in retreat.",
3462,"Nor are you (able) to show the right path to the blind against their straying. You can make none to listen except those who believe in Our signs, hence they submit.",
3463,"Allah is the One who created you in a state of weakness, then He created strength after weakness, then created weakness and old age after strength. He creates what He wills, and He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.",
3464,"And on the Day when the Hour (Qiyāmah : the Day of Judgement) will take place, the sinners will swear that they did not remain (in the graves) more than one hour. In the similar way they used to be contrary (to truth in their worldly life).",
3465,"As for those who were given knowledge and belief, they will say, “You remained, according to the destiny written by Allah, up to the Day of Resurrection. So this is the Day of Resurrection, but you had no belief.”",
3466,"So, on that Day, their apology will not benefit the wrongdoers, nor will they be asked to repent.",
3467,"Indeed We have given in this Qur’ān all kinds of examples for the benefit of mankind. (Still) if you bring to them a sign, the disbelievers will certainly say, “You are nothing but men of falsehood.”",
3468,Thus Allah seals up the hearts of those who do not believe.,

So, when Zaid finished his desire for her, We gave her into your marriage, so that there may not be a problem for the believers in marrying wives of their adopted sons, when they finish their desire for them; and Allah’s decree had to be enforced.",
3571,"There is no problem for the prophet in (doing) what Allah has prescribed for him, a customary practice of Allah in the case of those who have gone before - and Allah’s command is pre-determined by destiny -",

Then, once you have had the meal, just disperse, and (do) not (sit for long) being keen for a chat. This (conduct of yours) hurts the Prophet, but he feels shy of (telling) you (about it), but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask any thing from them (the blessed wives of the Prophet), ask them from behind a curtain. That is better for the purity of your hearts and their hearts. It is not allowed for you that you hurt Allah’s Messenger, nor that you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed, it would be an enormity in the sight of Allah.",

3719,"when We sent to them two (apostles), and they rejected both of them, so We confirmed them with a third one. So they said, “We are sent to you.”",
3720,"They (the people of the Town) said, “You are no more than human beings like us, and the RaHmān (the All-Merciful Allah) has not sent down any thing. You are but telling a lie.”",

3745,"Neither it is for the sun to overtake the moon, nor can the night outpace the day. Each one is floating in an orbit.",
3746,"And it is a sign for them that We boarded their children in the loaded ship,",

3837,"as if they were eggs hidden (under feathers, protected from pollution).",
3838,Then they will turn to each other asking questions mutually.,
3839,"A speaker from them will say, “I had a companion (in the worldly life)",

3841,Is it when we have died and become dust and bones? Is it true that we are going to be recompensed (for our deeds)?”,
3842,He (the speaker) will say (to other people in Paradise) “Would you like to have a look (at Jahannam to find out what happened to that companion of mine)?”,

3869,He was one of Our believing servants.,
3870,"Then, we drowned others.",
3871,And certainly one of his adherents was Ibrāhīm.,
3872,"(Remember) when he came to his Lord with a pure heart,",
3873,"when he said to his father and his people, “What is that which you worship?",
3874,Do you wish (to have) fallacious gods other than Allah?,
3875,"Then, what do you think about the Lord of the worlds?”",

3879,"And he made his way to their ‘gods’ and said to them, “Why would you not eat?",

3883,"He said, “Do you worship what is carved by yourselves,",
3884,while Allah has created you and what you make?”,
3885,"They said, “Build for him a structure, and throw him into the blazing fire.”",
3886,"So, they intended to bring harm to him, but We made them the lowest (by frustrating their plan).",
3887,"And he said, “I am going to my Lord. He will show me the way.",
3888,"O my Lord, bless me with a righteous son.”",
3889,"So, We gave him the good news of a forbearing boy.",
3890,"Thereafter, when he (the boy) reached an age in which he could work with him, he (Ibrāhīm) said, “O my little son, I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you, so consider, what is your opinion?” He said, “O my dear father, do what you have been ordered to do. You will find me, inshā’allah , (if Allah wills) one of those who endure patiently.”",
3891,"So, (it was a great episode) when both of them submitted themselves (to Allah’s will), and he laid him on his forehead (to slaughter him),",
3892,"and then We called out to him, “O Ibrāhīm,",
3893,you did make the dream come true.” This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.,
3894,This was indeed a trial that clearly demonstrated (their obedience).,
3895,"And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice,",
3896,"and We left for him (a word of praise) among the later people,",
3897,"(that is,) “Salām be on Ibrāhīm!",
3898,This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds.,
3899,"Surely, he is among Our believing servants.",
3900,"And We gave him the good news of IsHāq (Isaac), a prophet from among the righteous.",
3901,"And We did bless him, and IsHāq. And among the progeny of both of them, some are good and some are utterly unjust to their own selves.",
3902,"Certainly We bestowed favors upon Mūsā and Hārūn,",
3903,"and We delivered them and their people from the great agony,",
3904,"and We helped them, so they became victors,",
3905,"and We gave them the clear book,",
3906,and guided them to the straight path.,

3912,(Remember) when he said to his people: “Do you not fear Allah?,
3913,"Do you invoke Ba‘l, and ignore the Best of the creators,",
3914,"that is, Allah who is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?”",
3915,"Then they rejected him. Therefore, they will be arraigned -",

3928,(Remember) when he ran away towards the boat that was already loaded.,
3929,Then he participated in drawing lots (to offload one of the passengers) and was the one who was defeated.,
3930,Then the fish swallowed him while he was reproaching his own self.,
3931,"Had he not been of those who proclaim Allah’s purity,",
3932,he would have definitely lived in its belly till the day when the dead will be raised.,
3933,"Then We cast him ashore in the open while he was ill,",
3934,and We caused a tree of ourds to grow over him.,

3936,"So, they believed, then, We let them enjoy for a time.",
3937,"So ask them, “Does your Lord have daughters while they have sons?”",

3989,"and the birds as well, mustered together. All were turning to Allah with him.",

3994,"He (Dawūd) said, “He has certainly wronged you by demanding your ewe to be added to his ewe. Many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and very few they are.” And Dawūd realized that We had put him to a test, so he prayed to his Lord for forgiveness, and bowing down, he fell in prostration, and turned (to Allah).",
3995,"So we forgave him that (lapse), and surely he has a place of nearness in Our presence, and an excellent resort.",

4373,"And We did not show them a sign, but it used to be greater than the one that preceded it. And We seized them with punishment, so that they may return.",
4374,"And they said, “O magician, pray for us to your Lord by the covenant He has made with you; we will certainly come to guidance.”",
4375,"Then, once We removed the punishment from them, in no time they broke their promise.",

4491,"Then We have put you on a certain way of the Matter (i.e. the religion); so follow it, and do not follow the desires of those who do not know.",

Surely, Allah does not give guidance to the unjust people.",
4521,"The disbelievers say about the believers, “Had it (Islamic faith) been a good thing, these (weak and poor) people would not have preceded us (in proceeding) towards it.” Since they did not accept guidance through it (the Qur’ān), they will say, “This is a classical lie.”",
4522,"And before this there was the Book of Mūsā, a guide and a mercy. And this is a Book confirming (it) in Arabic tongue, so that it may warn the wrongdoers and give good news to those who are good in their deeds.",

Do you promise to me that I shall be brought out (from the grave), while generations have passed before me?” And they (the parents) were crying for Allah’s help, (and saying to their son,) “Woe to you. Accept the true faith. Allah’s promise is certainly true.” Then he says, “This is nothing but the tales of the ancients.”",
4528,Such are the people on whom the word (of punishment) has come true along with the communities of the Jinn and the humans that have passed before them. Surely they were losers.,

4530,"And the day the disbelievers will be presented before the Fire, (it will be said to them,) “You have consumed your good things in your worldly life, and have enjoyed them. So, you will be punished today with the torment of humiliation for the arrogance you used to show on earth with no right (to do so), and for the sins you used to commit.",
4531,"And recall the brother of (the nation of) ‘Ād, when he warned his people at the long, curved sand dunes- while many warners have passed before him and after him (with the same message)-saying, “Do not worship anyone except Allah. Surely I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day.”",
4532,"They said, “Have you come to make us deviate from our gods? So bring us that with which you are threatening us, if you are truthful.”",

4537,"And We have (also) destroyed (other) towns around you, while We had given to them a variety of signs, so that they might return (from disbelief).",
4538,"So, why is it that they were not helped by those whom they had taken as gods beside Allah in order to attain closeness (to Him)? Instead, they vanished from them. That was, in fact, their falsity and a thing they used to fabricate.",
4539,"And (recall) when We directed a group of Jinns towards you, listening to the Qur’ān. So, when they attended it, they said (to each other), “Keep quiet.” Then once it was over, they went back to their people as warners.",
4540,"They said, “O our people, we have heard a book sent down after Mūsā, confirming what was before it, which guides to the truth and to a straight path.",

4543,"Have they not seen that Allah who has created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, does have power to give life to the dead? Yes of course, He is powerful to do every thing.",
4544,"The day the disbelievers will be presented to the Fire, (it will be said to them,) “Is this not true?” They will say, “Yes of course, Our Lord!” He will say, “Then taste the punishment, for you used to disbelieve.”",
4545,"So, (O prophet,) observe patience, as the resolute messengers observed patience, and be not in haste about them. The Day they will see what they are promised, (it will be) as if they did not stay (in the world) more than an hour in a single day. This is a message. So, none will be destroyed except the sinners.",
4546,"Those who disbelieved, and prevented (others) from Allah’s way, He (Allah) has rendered their deeds vain.",
4547,"And those who believed and did righteous deeds and believed in that which is revealed to MuHammad,-and it is the truth (that has come) from their Lord-He will write off their evil deeds, and will set aright their state of affairs.",
4548,"That is because the disbelievers have followed falsehood, while the believers have followed the truth (that has come) from their Lord. This is how Allah explains their (respective) situations to the people.",
4549,"So, when you encounter those who disbelieve, then (aim at) smiting the necks, until when you have broken their strength thoroughly, then tie fast the bond, (by making them captives). Then choose (to release them) either (as) a favour (shown to them,), or (after receiving) ransom,until the war throws down its load of arms. That (is Our command.) If Allah willed, He would have (Himself) subjected them to retribution, but (Allah ordered you to fight,) so that He may test some of you through some others. And those who are killed in Allah’s way, He will never let their deeds go to waste.",
4550,"(Instead,) He will guide them, and will set aright their state of affairs,",
4551,and will admit them to the Paradise He has identified for them.,
4552,"O you who believe, if you will help (the religion prescribed by) Allah, He will help you, and will stabilize your footings.",
4553,"As for those who disbelieve, (destined) for them is destruction, and He has rendered their deeds vain.",
4554,That is because they hate what Allah has sent down; therefore Allah has nullified their deeds.,
4555,Have they not travelled in the land so that they might see how was the end of those before them? Allah brought utter destruction to them. And (ready) for (these) disbelievers are the likes thereof.,
4556,"That is because Allah is the supporter of those who believe. As for the disbelievers, there is no supporter for them.",
4557,"Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to the gardens beneath which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy (the worldly life), and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire is the final abode for them.",
4558,"How many a town, stronger in might than your town that has expelled you, have We destroyed! Then, there was none to help them.",
4559,"Then, can one who holds on to a clear proof from his Lord be like those for whom their evil deeds are beautified, and who followed their desires?",
4560,"(Here is) a description of the Paradise that is promised for the God-fearing! In it there are rivers of water, never spoiling, and rivers of milk the taste of which would not go bad, and rivers of wine, delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of honey, fully purified. And for them there are all sorts of fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord. Are they like those who will live in Fire forever, and will be given boiling water to drink, and it will tear their bowels into pieces?",
4561,"Among them there are ones who (pretend to) give ear to you, until when they go out from your presence, they say to those who have been given knowledge, “What did he say just now?” Those are the ones on whose hearts Allah has put a seal, and they have followed their desires.",
4562,"As for those who have adopted right path, Allah improves them in guidance, and gives them their piety.",

4780,"So, leave them alone until they face their Day, in which they will be turned unconscious,",
4781,"the Day their planning will not benefit them in the least, nor will they be helped.",
4782,"And for those who did wrong there is another punishment before that, but most of them do not know.",
4783,"And (O Prophet) be patient about the decision of your Lord, because you are in front of Our Eyes. And proclaim the purity of your Lord along with His praise when you stand (in Prayer),",
4784,"And, in parts of night too, proclaim His purity, and at the time of setting of the stars.",
4785,"By the star when it goes down to set,",
4786,"your fellow (the Holy Prophet) has neither missed the way, nor did he deviate.",
4787,He does not speak out of (his own) desire.,
4788,It is but revelation revealed (to him).,
4789,"It is taught to him by one (angel) of strong faculties,",
4790,"the one of vigour. So he stood poised,",
4791,while he was on the upper horizon.,
4792,"Then he drew near, and came down,",
4793,"so as he was at a distance like that of two bows (joined together), rather even nearer.",
4794,Thus He (Allah) revealed to His slave what He revealed.,
4795,The heart did not err in what he saw.,
4796,Do you quarrel with him in what he sees?,
4797,Indeed he saw him another time,
4798,"by Sidrat-ul-Muntahā (the lote-tree in the upper realm),",
4799,"near which there is Jannat-ul-Ma’wā (the Paradise of Abode),",
4800,when the lote-tree was covered by that which covered it.,
4801,"The eye neither went wrong, nor did exceed the limit.",
4802,He has indeed seen a part of the biggest signs of your Lord.,
4803,"Have you ever considered about the (idols of) Lāt and ‘Uzzā,",
4804,"and about the other, the third (idol), namely, Manāt,?",
4805,Is it that you have males and He (Allah) has females?,
4806,"If so, it is a bizarre division.",
4807,"These are nothing but names you and your fathers have invented; Allah has sent down no authority attached to them. They are following nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire, while guidance from their Lord has surely reached them.",
4808,Is it that man can get whatever he wishes?,
4809,"(No,) because to Allah alone belongs the (good of) the Hereafter and the former life (of this world).",
4810,"How many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession cannot benefit (any one) at all, but after Allah allows (it) for whomsoever He wills and pleases.",
4811,Those who do not believe in the Hereafter call the angels by names of females.,
4812,"They do not have knowledge about it. They follow nothing but conjecture, and conjecture is of no avail in (the matter of) Truth.",
4813,"So, turn away from him who turns away from Our advice, and seeks nothing but (pleasure of) the worldly life.",
4814,"That is the limit of their access to knowledge. Indeed only your Lord knows well about the one who has gone astray from his way, and He knows well about the one who has adopted the right path.",
4815,"To Allah belongs whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth, so that He gives punishment to evildoers for what they did, and gives good reward to those who did good",
4816,"-those who abstain from the major sins and from shameful acts, except minor involvements. Indeed your Lord is extensive in forgiveness. He knows you more than anyone else (from a time) when He created you from the earth and when you were embryos in the wombs of your mothers. So, do not claim purity (from faults) for your selves. He knows best who is God-fearing.",
4817,"Did you see the one who turned away,",
4818,"and gave a little, and stopped?",
4819,Does he have knowledge of the Unseen whereby he sees (what he believes)?,
4820,Has he not been told of what was (revealed) in the scriptures of Mūsā,
4821,and of Ibrāhīm who fulfilled (his duties)?,
4822,"(It was) that no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of the other,",
4823,"and that a man shall not deserve but (the reward of) his own effort,",
4824,"and that his effort will soon be seen,",
4825,"then he will be recompensed for it in full,",
4826,"and that to your Lord is the end (of every one),",
4827,"and that He is the One who makes (one) laugh and makes (him) weep,",
4828,"and that He is the One who gives death and gives life,",
4829,"and that He creates the pairs, male and female,",
4830,"from a sperm-drop when it is poured (into a womb),",
4831,"and that the second creation is undertaken by Him,",
4832,"and that He is the One who gives wealth and preserves (it),",
4833,"and that He is the One who is the Lord of Sirius (the star worshipped by pagans),",
4834,"and that He has destroyed the earlier ‘Ād,",
4835,"and Thamūd, so spared none,",
4836,and (destroyed) the people of NūH even earlier. Surely they were more unjust and more rebellious.,
4837,"And He destroyed the overturned towns (of the people of LūT) also,",
4838,so enveloped they were by that which enveloped.,
4839,Then concerning which of your Lord’s bounties would you remain in doubt?,
4840,This (Prophet) is a warner from the (genus of the) previous warners.,
4841,The Imminent (Hour of Judgment) has approached.,
4842,"There is no one, beside Allah, to remove it.",
4843,"Do you then wonder at this discourse,",
4844,"and laugh (at it), and not weep,",
4845,while you are engaged in vain play?,
4846,"Now, fall down in prostration and worship (Allah).",
4847,"The Hour (of doom) has drawn near, and the moon has split asunder.",
4848,"When these people see a sign, they turn away and say, “(This is) a transient magic.”",
4849,"They have rejected (the Truth) and followed their desires, while every matter has to settle (at some time).",
4850,"And there has come to them as much news (of the earlier communities) as it is enough to deter,",
4851,(containing) a perfect wisdom. But the warnings are of no avail (to them).,
4852,"Therefore, turn aside (O Prophet,) from them. (They will see the reality) on the day in which the caller will call (them) to a gruesome object.",
4853,"With their eyes humbled, they will come out of the graves like locusts spread all over,",
4854,"rushing quickly towards the caller. (On that Day) the disbelievers will say, “This is a hard day.”",
4855,"The people of NūH denied (the truth) before them. So they rejected Our servant, and said, “(He is) a madman”, and he was (also) threatened (by them).",
4856,"So he prayed to his Lord saying, “I am overpowered, so defend (me).”",
4857,"So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring forth profusely,",
4858,and We caused the earth to gush forth as springs; so the water (of both kinds) met together for a destined event.,
4859,"And We caused him (NūH) to board that (ship) which had planks and nails,",
4860,"which sailed under Our Eyes, as a reward for the one who was rejected (by the infidels).",
4861,"And We left it (the ship) as a sign. So, is there one to take lesson?",
4862,Then how was My torment and My warnings?,
4863,"Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
4864,(The people of) ‘Ād rejected (their prophet). So how was My torment and My warnings?,
4865,"We did send to them a furious wind in a day of continuous misfortune,",
4866,"plucking people away, as if they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.",
4867,So how was My torment and My warnings?,
4868,"Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
4869,(The people of) Thamūd rejected the warners.,
4870,"So they said, “Shall we follow a single human being from among us? Then we will be in error and insanity.",
4871,"Is it that the advice has been cast upon him alone out of all of us? No, but he is a bragging liar.”",
4872,Tomorrow they will know who the bragging liar is!,
4873,"We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch them (O SāliH,) and keep patience,",
4874,"and tell them that water (of the well) is to be shared between them (and the she-camel), so as the right of having water shall be attended by each (alternatively).",
4875,"Then they called their man (to kill the she-camel,) so he undertook (the task) and killed (the she-camel).",
4876,So how was My torment and My warnings?,
4877,"We sent upon them a single Cry, and they were like crushed leafs of a hedge-builder.",
4878,"Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
4879,The people of LūT rejected the warners.,
4880,"We sent upon them a rain of stones, except the family of LūT whom We saved in the last hours of night,",
4881,as a grace from Us. This is how We reward the one who offers gratitude.,
4882,"And he (LūT) had certainly warned them of Our grasp, but they disputed the warnings.",
4883,"And they had even tried to tempt him against his guests (so that they may snatch them away for bad purpose,) but We blinded their eyes: “Now taste My torment and My warnings!”",
4884,"And on the next morning, a lasting torment overtook them:",
4885,“Now taste My torment and My warnings.”,
4886,"Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
4887,And the warners came to the family of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh).,
4888,"(But) they rejected all Our signs; so We seized them- a seizure by One Mighty, Powerful.",
4889,"Are the disbelievers among you in a better position than all of the aforesaid (punished people), or do you have immunity (recorded) in the sacred books?",
4890,"Or do they say, “We are a large group, well-defended.”?",
4891,"Soon this ‘large group’ shall be defeated, and all of them will turn their backs.",
4892,"Rather the Hour (of judgment) is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour is more calamitous and much more bitter.",
4893,Surely the guilty ones are in error and madness.,
4894,"On the Day when they will be dragged into the Fire on their faces, (it will be said to them,) “Taste the touch of Hell.”",
4895,"Verily, We have created every thing according to (Our) predestination.",
4896,And (implementation of) Our command is no more than a single act like the twinkling of an eye.,
4897,"We have destroyed people like you; so, is there one to take lesson?",
4898,And every thing they have done is recorded in the books (of deeds).,
4899,"And every thing, small and big, is written down.",
4900,"Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and rivers,",
4901,"in a seat of Truth, near to the Omnipotent Sovereign.",
4902,The RaHmān (The All-Merciful Allah),
4903,has taught the Qur’ān.,
4904,He has created man.,
4905,He has taught him (how) to express himself.,
4906,The sun and the moon are (bound) by a (fixed) calculation.,
4907,And the vine and the tree both prostrate (to Allah).,
4908,"He raised the sky high, and has placed the scale,",
4909,so that you should not be wrongful in weighing.,
4910,"Observe the correct weight with fairness, and do not make weighing deficient.",
4911,"As for the earth, He has placed it for creatures,",
4912,"in which there are fruits and date palms having sheaths,",
4913,"and the grain having chaff, and fragrant flowers.",
4914,"So, (O mankind and Jinn,) which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4915,"He has created man from dry clay, ringing like pottery,",
4916,and created Jann (father of the Jinn) from a smokeless flame of fire.,
4917,"So, (O mankind and Jinn,) which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4918,He is the Lord of both points of sunrise and both points of sunset.,
4919,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4920,"He let forth the two seas to meet together,",
4921,while there is a barrier between them; they do not encroach (upon one another).,
4922,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4923,From both of them come forth the pearl and the coral.,
4924,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4925,And His are the sailing ships raised up in the sea like mountains.,
4926,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4927,Every one who is on it (the earth) has to perish.,

4929,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4930,All those in the heavens and the earth beseech Him (for their needs.) Every day He is in a state of action.,
4931,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4932,"Soon We are going to spare Ourselves for you (to reckon your deeds), O two heavy species (of Jinn and mankind)!",
4933,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4934,"O genera of Jinn and mankind, If you are able to penetrate beyond the realms of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate. You cannot penetrate without power.",
4935,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4936,"A flame of fire and a smoke will be loosed against you, and you will not (be able) to defend.",
4937,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4938,"So, (it will be a terrible event) when the sky will be split apart and will become rosy, like (red) hides.",
4939,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4940,"On that day, neither a man will be questioned about his sin, nor a Jinn.",
4941,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4942,The guilty ones will be recognized (by angels) through their marks and will be seized by foreheads and feet.,

4946,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4947,"And for the one who is fearful of having to stand before his Lord, there are two gardens, -",
4948,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4949,- both having branches.,
4950,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4951,In both there are two flowing springs.,
4952,"So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
4953,In both there are two kinds of every fruit.,

And establish Salāh, and pay Zakāh, and advance to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send ahead for your own-selves, you will find it with Allah much better in condition, and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Indeed Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
5496,"O you, enveloped in a mantle,",
5497,"stand up and warn,",
5498,"and pronounce the greatness of your Lord,",
5499,"and purify your clothes,",
5500,"and keep away from filth,",
5501,and do not do a favour (to anyone merely) to seek more (in return).,
5502,"And for the sake of your Lord, observe patience.",
5503,"For when the trumpet will be blown,",
5504,"that day will be a difficult day,",
5505,not easy for the disbelievers.,
5506,"Leave me alone (to deal) with the one whom I created lonely,",
5507,"and gave him extensive wealth,",
5508,"and sons present before (his) eyes,",
5509,and extended (power and honour) to him pretty well.,
5510,"Still, he aspires that I should give him more.",
5511,Never! He is inimical towards Our verses.,
5512,I will force him to climb the mountain Sa‘ūd.,
5513,He pondered and surmised.,
5514,Death onto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!,
5515,"Again, death unto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!",
5516,"Then he looked (to those around him,)",
5517,"then he frowned and scowled,",
5518,"then turned his back, and waxed proud,",
5519,"then said, “This is nothing but traditional magic;",
5520,this is nothing but saying of a mortal.”,
5521,I will put him into Saqar (Hell).,
5522,And what can let you know what Saqar is?,
5523,It neither spares (anything inside it from burning) nor leaves (any disbeliever outside).,
5524,It will disfigure the skins.,
5525,Appointed on it are nineteen (wardens).,
5526,"And We did not make wardens of the Fire but (from) angels, and did not fix their number but as a test for those who disbelieve, so that those who are given the Book may come to believe, and those who believe may improve in belief, and so that those who are given the Book and those who believe may not doubt (its correctness), and so that those having malady in their hearts and the disbelievers say, “What has Allah meant by this strange statement?” Thus Allah lets go astray whomever He wills, and leads to the right path whomever He wills. And no one knows the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is nothing else but a reminder for mankind.",
5527,"Truly, I swear by the moon,",
5528,"and by the night when it goes back,",
5529,"and by the morning when it becomes bright,",
5530,it (Saqar : Hell) is one of the greatest things,
5531,"as a warning to the mankind,",
5532,to the one from among you who wishes to come forward (towards good deeds) or to go back (from them).,
5533,"Everyone will be detained (in the Hell) because of what he did,",
5534,"except the People of the Right, (i.e. those who will be given their Book of Deeds in their right hands)",
5535,"who will be in gardens, asking",
5536,"about the guilty persons,",
5537,“What has brought you to Saqar? (Hell)”,

5540,"and we indulged (in mocking at the truth) along with those who indulged,",
5541,"and we used to deny the Day of Requital,",
5542,until when we were overtaken by that which is certain.”,
5543,Then intercession of intercessors will not benefit them.,
5544,"So what has happened to them that they are turning away from the Reminder,",
5545,"as if they were wild donkeys,",
5546,fleeing from a lion?,
5547,"Rather, every one of them wishes that he should be given unrolled (divine) scriptures.",
5548,Never! But they do not fear the Hereafter.,
5549,"Never! Indeed, this is a Reminder.",
5550,"So, whoever so wishes may take advice from it.",
5551,"And they will not take advice unless Allah so wills. He is worthy to be feared, and worthy to forgive.",
5552,"I swear by the Day of Resurrection,",
5553,"and I swear by the self-reproaching conscience, (that Resurrection is a reality.)",
5554,Does man think that We will never reassemble his bones?,
5555,"Why (can We) not (do so), while We are able to reset (even) his fingertips perfectly?",
5556,But man wishes to go on violating Allah’s injunctions (even in future) ahead of him.,
5557,"He asks, “When will be this Day of Resurrection?”",
5558,"So, when the eyes will be dazzled,",
5559,"and the moon will lose its light,",
5560,"and the sun and the moon will be joined together,",
5561,"on that day man will say, “Where to escape?”",
5562,Never! There will be no refuge at all.,
5563,"On that day, towards your Lord will be the destination (of everyone.)",
5564,Man will be informed of what he sent ahead and what he left behind.,
5565,"Rather, man will be a witness against himself,",
5566,even though he may offer his excuses.,
5567,"(O Prophet,) do not move your tongue (during revelation) for (reciting) it (the Qur’ān) to receive it in hurry.",
5568,"It is surely undertaken by Us to store it (in your heart), and to let it be recited (by you after revelation is completed).",
5569,"Therefore, when it is recited by Us (through the angel), follow its recitation (by concentration of your heart).",
5570,"Then, it is undertaken by Us to explain it.",
5571,"Never, (your denial of Resurrection is never based on any sound reason!) Instead, you love that which is immediate,",
5572,and neglect the Hereafter.,
5573,"Many faces, that day, will be glowing,",
5574,"looking towards their Lord,",
5575,"and many faces, that day, will be gloomy,",
5576,realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them.,
5577,"Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles,",

5579,"and he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,)",
5580,"and one shank is intertwined with the other shank,",
5581,"then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven.",
5582,"So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed,",
5583,"but rejected the truth and turned away (from it),",
5584,"then he went to his home, puffed up with pride.",
5585,"(It will be said to such a man,) Woe to you, then woe to you!",
5586,"Again, woe to you, then woe to you!",
5587,Does man presume that he will be left unchecked?,
5588,Was he not an ejaculated drop of semen?,
5589,"Then he became a clot of blood, then He created (him) and made (him) perfect,",
5590,"and made from him two kinds, male and female.",
5591,Has He no power to give life to the dead?,
5592,There has come upon man a period of time in which he was nothing worth mentioning.,
5593,"We have created man from a mixed sperm-drop to put him to a test; then We made him able to hear, able to see.",
5594,We have shown him the way to be either grateful or ungrateful.,
5595,"We have prepared, for the disbelievers, shackles and iron-collars and a blazing Fire.",
5596,"Indeed, the righteous will have a drink from a goblet, blended with (a drink from) Camphor",
5597,"that will be a spring from which Allah’s servants will drink, making it flow (wherever they wish) profusely.",
5598,"They (are the ones who) fulfill their vows, and fear a day whose evil (events) will spread far and wide,",
5599,"and they give food, out of their love for Him (Allah), to the needy, and the orphan, and the captive,",

5602,"So Allah will save them from the evil of that day, and will grant them bloom and delight,",
5603,"and will give them, in return for their patience, Paradise and (garments of) silk,",
5604,"wherein they will be reclining on couches, feeling neither heat of the sun nor intense cold.",
5605,"And shades of gardens will be hanging low on them, and their fruits will be placed totally under their command.",
5606,"Circulated among them will be vessels of silver, and cups that will be (as transparent as) crystals,",
5607,"-crystals (as shining as if made) of silver, measured by those (who filled them) with due measure.",
5608,"And they will be served with goblet of a drink blended with ginger,",
5609,(acquired from) a spring therein called Salsabīl.,
5610,"And circling around them will be serving boys, blessed with eternal youth; when you would see them, you would take them as scattered pearls.",
5611,"When you will look around there, you will see the Bliss and a magnificent realm.",
5612,"Upon them will be garments of green sundus (a kind of fine silk), and of istabraq (a kind of thick silk), and they will be adorned by bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them a pure beverage to drink:",
5613,"“This is a reward for you, and your effort has been appreciated.”",
5614,Indeed we have revealed to you the Qur’ān through a gradual process.,
5615,"So, be steadfast patiently in (obeying) your Lord’s command, and do not obey any one of them who is sinner or ungrateful.",
5616,And pronounce the name of Allah morning and evening.,
5617,"And in some parts of night prostrate yourself before Him, and pronounce His purity for long times at night.",
5618,"In fact these people love that which is immediate, and neglect a Heavy Day ahead of them.",
5619,"We have created them and have made their joints strong. And whenever We will, We would replace them with others like them, a total replacement.",
5620,"Indeed, this is a reminder; so let anyone who so wishes, adopt a way to his Lord.",
5621,"And you will not so wish unless Allah so wills. Indeed Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
5622,"He admits whomsoever He wills to His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment.",
5623,"(I swear) by those (winds) that are sent one after the other,",
5624,"and by those that blow violently,",
5625,"and by those that spread (clouds) all over,",
5626,"and by those (angels) who differentiate (between right and wrong) distinctly,",
5627,"then bring down the advice,",
5628,"leaving no excuse (for the disbelievers) or giving warnings,",
5629,that which you are promised is sure to happen.,
5630,"So, when the stars will be extinguished,",
5631,"and when the sky will be split,",
5632,"and when the mountains will be blown away as dust,",
5633,"and when the messengers will be assembled at the appointed time, (then all matters will be decided.)",
5634,(Do you know) for which day has all this been delayed?,
5635,For the Day of Decision!,
5636,And what may let you know what the Day of Decision is?,
5637,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5638,Did We not destroy the earlier people?,
5639,Then We will cause the later ones to follow them.,
5640,Thus We deal with the guilty people.,
5641,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5642,Did We not create you from a worthless fluid?,
5643,Then We put it in a firm place of rest,
5644,for a known period.,
5645,Thus We did (all this with perfect) measure; so We are the best to measure.,
5646,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5647,Did We not make the earth a container that collects,
5648,the living and the dead?,
5649,"And We placed towering mountains therein, and provided you with sweet water to drink.",
5650,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5651,"(It will be said to them on that day,) “Push on to what you used to deny.",
5652,"Push on to a canopy (of Hell’s smoke) having three branches,",
5653,"that neither has a comfortable shade, nor is it of any use against the scorching heat.",
5654,"It emits sparks (as huge) as castles,",
5655,as if they were yellowish camels.”,
5656,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5657,"This is the day when they will not speak,",
5658,nor will they be allowed to offer excuses.,
5659,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5660,"(It will be said to them,) “This is the Day of Decision. We have assembled you and the earlier ones together.",
5661,"Now, if you have a trick, use the trick against Me.”",
5662,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5663,"Of course, the God-fearing will be amid shades and streams,",
5664,and fruits of their desire.,
5665,"It will be said to them, “Eat and drink with pleasure because of what you used to do.”",
5666,This is how We reward those who do good deeds.,
5667,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5668,"“(O disbelievers,) eat and drink for a while! You are guilty ones.”",
5669,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5670,"And when it is said to them, “Bow down (i.e. submit to Allah’s commands)”, they do not bow down.",
5671,Woe that Day to the deniers!,
5672,"Now, in which discourse, after this, will they believe?",
5673,About what are they asking each other?,
5674,About the Great Event,
5675,in which they dispute!,
5676,Indeed they will soon know.,
5677,"Again, indeed they will soon know.",
5678,"Did We not make the earth a floor,",
5679,and the mountains bulwarks?,
5680,"And We have created you in pairs,",
5681,"and made your sleep a source of rest,",
5682,"and made the night a covering,",
5683,and made the day a source of livelihood.,
5684,"And We have built seven strong (skies),",
5685,and created a luminous lamp (the sun).,
5686,"And We have sent down abundant water from the rain-laden clouds,",
5687,"so that We bring out therewith grain and vegetation,",
5688,and thick gardens.,
5689,"Surely the Day of Decision is an appointed time,",
5690,"a day when the trumpet will be blown, so you will come in multitudes,",
5691,"and the sky will be opened, so it will become as gates,",
5692,"and the mountains will be set in motion, so they will be as mirage.",
5693,Surely Jahannam (the Hell) lurks in ambush.,
5694,(It is) abode for the rebellious people,
5695,who will be abiding in it for ages.,
5696,"They will taste nothing cool in it, nor a drink,",
5697,"except boiling water and pus,",
5698,"this being a punishment, fully commensurate (with their deeds).",
5699,"They did not expect (to face) accounting (of their deeds),",
5700,and they rejected Our signs totally.,
5701,And everything (from their deeds) is thoroughly recorded by Us in writing.,
5702,“So now taste! We will add nothing to you but torment.”,
5703,"Of course, the God-fearing will have great achievement,",
5704,"-gardens and grapes,",
5705,"and buxom maidens of matching age,",
5706,and goblets filled up to the brim.,
5707,"They will not hear any vain talk therein, nor lies,",
5708,"this being a reward from their Lord, a well calculated grant,",
5709,"(from) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the All-Merciful. No one will have power to address Him,",
5710,"on the Day when the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows. They will not speak, except the one who is permitted by the RaHmān (the All-Merciful Allah) and speaks aright.",
5711,That is the Day that is sure to come. So whoever so wishes may take refuge with his Lord.,
5712,"We have warned you of an approaching torment (that will be inflicted) on a day when one will see what his hands have sent ahead, and the disbeliever will say, “O would that I had turned into dust.”",
5713,"I swear by those (angels) who pull out (the souls of the infidels) with extreme force,",
5714,"and by those (angels) who untie the knot (of the souls of the believers) smoothly,",
5715,"and by those who float (in the atmosphere) swiftly,",
5716,"then proceed forward quickly,",
5717,"then manage (to do) everything (they are ordered to do,)",
5718,"(you will be resurrected) on the Day when the shocking event (i.e. the first blowing of the trumpet) will shock (everything),",
5719,followed by the next one (i.e. the second blowing of the trumpet.),
5720,"On that day, hearts (of people) will be throbbing,",
5721,with their eyes downcast.,
5722,"They (the infidels) say, “Are we going to be brought back to our former state (of Life)?",
5723,Is it when we are turned into decayed bones?”,
5724,"They say, “If so, that will be a harmful homecoming.”",
5725,"In fact, it will be only a single harsh voice,",
5726,and in no time they will be (brought) into the plain (of Hashr).,
5727,Has there come to you the narrative about Mūsā?,
5728,(Recall) when his Lord called to him in the blessed valley of Tuwā:,
5729,"“Go to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh). Indeed, he has crossed all bounds.",
5730,"And say (to him,) ‘Would you like to purify yourself,",
5731,"and that I should guide you to your Lord, so that you fear (Him)?’”",
5732,"So, he (Mūsā) showed him the biggest sign.",
5733,"But he rejected and disobeyed,",
5734,"then he turned back, and tried hard (to refute the Messenger),",
5735,then he gathered (his people) and shouted,
5736,"and said, “I am your supreme lord.”",
5737,"So, Allah seized him for an exemplary punishment in the Hereafter and the present world.",
5738,"Indeed, there is a lesson for him who fears (Allah).",
5739,"Is your creation more difficult or that of the sky? He has built it,",
5740,"He has raised its height, then made it proper,",
5741,"and darkened its night, and brought forth its daylight,",
5742,"and, after that, He spread out the earth.",
5743,"From it, He brought out its water and its meadows,",
5744,"and firmly fixed the mountains,",
5745,(all this) as a benefit to you and your cattle.,
5746,So when the Greatest Havoc will take place,
5747,"on the day when man will recall what he did,",
5748,"and the Hell will be exposed for all who see,",
5749,"then for the one who had rebelled,",
5750,"and preferred the worldly life (to the Hereafter),",
5751,"the Hell will be the abode,",
5752,"whereas for the one who feared to stand before his Lord, and restrained his self from the (evil) desire,",
5753,the Paradise will be the abode.,
5754,"They ask you (O Prophet,) about the Hour (the Day of Judgment) as to when it will take place.",
5755,In which capacity are you to tell this?,
5756,With your Lord is the final word about it.,
5757,You are only a warner for anyone who fears it.,
5758,"The day they will see it, it will seem to them as if they did not live (in the world) but only for one afternoon or for the morning thereof.",
5759,"He (the Prophet) frowned and turned his face,",
5760,because the blind man came to him!,
5761,"What could tell you (O prophet about the prospects of the blind man?) May be, (if you had attended him properly,) he would have attained purity,",
5762,"or have received the advice, and the advice would have benefited him.",
5763,"As for the one who does not care (about faith),",
5764,"you are anxious to pursue him,",
5765,"while there is no blame on you, if he does not attain purity.",
5766,"As regards the one who has come to you rushing eagerly,",
5767,"while he fears (Allah),",
5768,to him you pay no heed!,
5769,"Never! (you should never act in this way,) Indeed this (Qur’ān) is an advice.",
5770,"So, whoever so wills may pay heed to it.",
5771,"It is (recorded) in those scripts (of the Preserved Tablet) that are honoured,",
5772,"exalted, purified,",
5773,in the hands of those scribes,
5774,"who are honorable, righteous.",
5775,Damned is the man! How ungrateful he is!,
5776,From which stuff did He (Allah) create him?,
5777,"from a drop of semen! He created him, and designed him in due proportion,",
5778,"then He made the way easy for him,",
5779,"Later, he made him die, and put him into grave,",
5780,"Thereafter, when He will intend, He will raise him up.",
5781,No! He has not yet fulfilled what He (Allah) had commanded him.,
5782,"So, the man should consider his food,",
5783,"how well We poured water,",
5784,"then how nicely We split the earth,",
5785,"then We grew in it grain,",
5786,"and grapes and greens,",
5787,"and olive and date-palms,",
5788,"and gardens, full of thick trees,",
5789,"and fruits and fodder,",
5790,as a benefit for you and your cattle.,
5791,"So when the Deafening Noise will occur,",
5792,"the Day when one will flee from his brother,",
5793,"and from his mother and father,",
5794,"and from his wife and sons,",
5795,every one of them will be too engaged in his own affairs to care for others.,
5796,"Many faces, on that day, will be bright,",
5797,"laughing, rejoicing,",
5798,"and many faces, on that day, will be stained with dust,",
5799,covered by darkness.,
5800,"Those are the disbelievers, the nefarious.",
5801,"When the sun will be folded up,",
5802,"and when the stars will swoop down,",
5803,"and when the mountains will be set in motion,",
5804,"and when the ten-months pregnant she-camels will be abandoned,",
5805,"and when the wild beasts will be gathered together,",
5806,"and when the seas will be flared up,",
5807,"and when the people will be arranged in categories,",
5808,"and when the girl-child that was buried alive will be asked,",
5809,"for what sin she was killed,",
5810,"and when the scrolls (of deeds) will be unrolled,",
5811,"and when the sky will be stripped off,",
5812,"and when the Hell will be set ablaze,",
5813,"and when the Paradise will be brought close,",
5814,then everyone will know what he (or she) has put forward.,
5815,"So, I swear by those (stars) that recede,",
5816,"that proceed, that withdraw from the scene,",
5817,"and by the night when it departs,",
5818,"and the morning when it starts breathing,",
5819,"it (the Qur’ān) is surely the word of a noble messenger (Jibra’īl X),",
5820,"the one possessing power and a high status with the Lord of the Throne,",
5821,"the one obeyed there, trusted.",
5822,"Your companion (Muhammad ) is not a madman,",
5823,and he did see him (Jibra’īl X) on the clear horizon.,
5824,And he (the Prophet) is not stingy about (the news of) the unseen.,
5825,Nor is it the word of an outcast satan (devil).,
5826,Then where are you going?,
5827,"It is nothing else but a message of advice for all the worlds,",
5828,for the benefit of any one from among you who intends to go straight.,
5829,"And you cannot intend (to do anything) unless it is so willed by Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.",
5830,"When the sky will be cleft asunder,",
5831,"and when the stars will disperse,",
5832,"and when the seas will be burst forth,",
5833,"and when the graves will be overturned,",
5834,then one will know what he sent ahead and what he left behind.,
5835,"O man! What has deceived you about your Gracious Lord,",
5836,"who created you, then perfected you, then brought you in due proportion?",
5837,He composed you in whichever form He willed.,
5838,"Never! (i.e. one should never be heedless towards him.) But you deny the Requital,",
5839,"while (appointed) over you there are watchers,",
5840,"who are noble, writers (of the deeds),",
5841,who know whatever you do.,
5842,"Surely the righteous will be in bliss,",
5843,"and the sinners in Hell,",
5844,"in which they will enter on the Day of Requital,",
5845,and they will not (be able to) keep away from it.,
5846,And what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?,
5847,"Again, what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?",
5848,"A Day when no one will have power to do any thing for another! And command, on that Day, will belong to Allah (alone).",
5849,Woe to the curtailers,
5850,"who, when they measure something to receive from people, take it in full,",
5851,"and when they measure or weigh something to give it to them, give less than due.",
5852,Do they not think that they have to be raised up,
5853,"on a Great Day,",
5854,the Day when all the people will stand before the Lord of the worlds?,
5855,Never! (i.e. they should never act in such a way.) Indeed the record of deeds of the sinners is in Sijjīn .,
5856,And what may let you know what Sijjīn is?,
5857,"A register, inscribed!",
5858,"Woe that day to the deniers,",
5859,who deny the Day of Requital!,
5860,And none denies it but every sinful transgressor.,
5861,"When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “(These are) tales of the ancients.”",
5862,No! But that which they used to commit has covered their hearts with rust.,
5863,No! Indeed they will be screened off from their Lord on that Day.,
5864,Then they will have to enter the Hell.,
5865,"Then it will be said, “This is what you used to deny.”",
5866,No! The record of deeds of the righteous is in ‘Illiyyūn .,
5867,And what may let you know what ‘Illiyyūn is ?,
5868,"A register inscribed,",
5869,attended by those (angels) who are blessed with nearness to Allah!,
5870,Indeed the righteous will be in absolute bliss.,
5871,While (sitting) on thrones they will be watching (the scenes of Paradise).,
5872,You will recognize the glamour of bliss on their faces.,
5873,"They will be served with a pure sealed wine to drink,",
5874,the seal of which will be of musk.-It is this (bliss) in aspiring for which the competitors should race each other.,
5875,"-and it will be blended with (a drink from) Tasnīm ,",
5876,a spring from which will drink those who are blessed with nearness.,
5877,"Indeed those who were guilty used to laugh at those who believed,",
5878,"and when they passed by them, they used to wink at one another,",
5879,"and when they went back to their family, they went enjoying their mockery,",
5880,"and when they saw them, they said, “Surely these are the ones who have gone astray”",
5881,while they were not sent as watchmen over them.,
5882,"So, today those who believed will laugh at the disbelievers.",
5883,"While (sitting) on thrones, they will be seeing",
5884,whether the disbelievers have been paid back for what they used to do.,
5885,"When the sky will split apart,",
5886,"and will listen to (the command of) its Lord,- and it ought to,-",
5887,"and when the earth will be stretched (to give room to more people),",
5888,"and it will throw up whatever it contains, and will become empty,",
5889,"and will listen to (the command of) its Lord,- and it ought to,- (then man will see the consequences of his deeds.)",
5890,"O man, you have to work hard constantly to reach your Lord, and then you have to meet Him.",
5891,"So, as for him whose book (of deeds) will be given to him in his right hand,",
5892,"he will be called to account in an easy manner,",
5893,and he will go back to his people joyfully.,
5894,"As for the one whose book (of deeds) will be given to him from his backside,",
5895,"he will pray for death,",
5896,and will enter the blazing fire.,
5897,He had been joyful among his people (in the world).,
5898,He thought he would never revert (to Allah).,
5899,No! Indeed his Lord was watchful over him.,
5900,"So, I swear by the twilight (after sunset),",
5901,"and by the night and what it envelops,",
5902,"and by the moon when it develops at the full,",
5903,you shall certainly ascend from stage to stage.,
5904,"So, what is wrong with them that they do not believe,",
5905,"and when the Qur’ān is recited to them, they do not offer sajdah (prostration)?",
5906,"Rather, those who disbelieve deny (the truth).",
5907,And Allah is most aware of what they store.,
5908,"So, give him the ‘good news’ of a painful punishment,",
5909,but those who believed and did righteous deeds will have a reward that will never be interrupted.,
5910,"I swear by the sky, the one having stellar formations,",
5911,"and by the Promised Day,",
5912,"and by that which attends, and that which is attended,",
5913,"cursed were the People of the Trench,",
5914,"the (people of the) fire that was rich with fuel,",
5915,"when they were sitting by it,",
5916,and were watching what they were doing with the believers.,
5917,"They punished them for nothing but that they believed in Allah, the All-Mighty, the Worthy of All Praise,",
5918,the One to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is witness over every thing.,
5919,"Surely, those who persecuted the believing men and the believing women, then did not repent, -for them there is the torment of Jahannam (Hell), and for them there is the torment of burning.",
5920,"As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, for them there are gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the big achievement.",
5921,The seizure of your Lord is severe indeed!,
5922,Surely He originates (creation) and repeats (it after death).,
5923,"And He is the Most-Forgiving, the Most-Loving,",
5924,"the Master of the Throne, the Glorious.",
5925,He is ever doer of what He intends.,
5926,"Has there come to you the story of the forces,",
5927,of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and Thamūd?,
5928,But those who disbelieve are (engaged) in denying (the truth).,
5929,Allah has encompassed them from all sides.,
5930,"The reality is that it is the glorious Qur’ān,",
5931,(recorded) in the Preserved Tablet (LauH MaHfūZ).,
5932,"I swear by the sky and by the Night-Comer,-",
5933,-and what may let you know what the Night-Comer is?,
5934,The star of piercing brightness!- -,
5935,"-there is no human being, but there is a watcher over him.",
5936,"So, let man consider of which stuff he is created.",
5937,He is created of spouting water,
5938,that comes out from between the loins and the chest-bones.,
5939,Surely He is Powerful to bring him back,
5940,"on a day when all the secrets will be searched out,",
5941,"and he will have neither strength (to defend), nor a supporter.",
5942,"I swear by the sky that rains,",
5943,"and the earth that cracks open (for plants),",
5944,"this is a decisive word,",
5945,and it is not a joke.,
5946,"They are devising plans,",
5947,and I Am devising plans.,
5948,So leave the disbelievers alone at the moment; give them respite for a while.,
5949,"Pronounce the purity of the name of your most exalted Lord,",
5950,"who created (everything), then made (it) well,",
5951,"and who determined a measure (for everything), then guided (it),",
5952,"and who brought forth pasturage,",
5953,then turned it into a blackening stubble.,
5954,"We will make you recite, then you will not forget",
5955,except that which Allah wills. Indeed He knows what is manifest and what is hidden.,
5956,And We will facilitate for you (to reach) the easiest way.,
5957,"So, extend advice (to people) if advice is useful.",
5958,"The one who fears (Allah) will observe the advice,",
5959,and it will be avoided by the most wretched one,
5960,"who will enter the Biggest Fire,",
5961,"then he will neither die therein, nor live (a desirable life).",
5962,"Success is surely achieved by him who purifies himself,",
5963,"and pronounces the name of his Lord, then offers prayer.",
5964,"But you prefer the worldly life,",
5965,while the Hereafter is much better and much more durable.,
5966,"Indeed this is (written) in the earlier divine scripts,",
5967,the scripts of Ibrāhīm and Mūsā.,
5968,Has there come to you the description of the Overwhelming Event?,
5969,"Many faces that day will be humbled,",
5970,"laboring, exhausted.",
5971,They will enter into the scorching fire.,
5972,They will be made to drink water from a boiling spring.,
5973,There will be no food for them except from a thorny plant,
5974,"that will neither nourish, nor satisfy hunger.",
5975,"Many faces that day will be full of glamour,",
5976,"well pleased with their endeavor,",
5977,"in a lofty garden,",
5978,in which they will not hear any absurd talk.,
5979,In it there is a flowing spring.,
5980,In it there are elevated couches,
5981,"and goblets, well placed,",
5982,"and cushions, arrayed",
5983,"and carpets, spread around.",
5984,"So, do they not look at the camels how they are created,",
5985,"and at the sky, how it is raised high,",
5986,"and at the mountains, how they are installed,",
5987,"and at the earth, how it is spread out?",
5988,"So, (O Prophet,) keep on preaching; you are only a preacher.",
5989,"You are not a taskmaster set up over them,",
5990,"but whoever turns away and disbelieves,",
5991,Allah will punish him with the greatest torment.,
5992,"Surely towards Us they have to return,",
5993,then it is Our job to call them to account.,
5994,"I swear by the dawn,",
5995,"and by Ten Nights,",
5996,"and by the even and the odd,",
5997,"and by the night when it moves away,",
5998,-Is there (not) in such an oath (enough assurance) for a man of sense?-,
5999,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with (the people) of ‘Ād,
6000,"of Iram , the men of tall pillars,",
6001,"the like of whom were never created in the lands,",
6002,"and (how He dealt) with (the people of) Thamūd who had carved out the rocks in the Valley (of Qurā),",
6003,"and with Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), the man of the stakes,",
6004,"- those who had rebelled in the cities,",
6005,and spread a lot of mischief therein.,
6006,"So, your Lord let loose on them the whip of torment.",
6007,Surely your Lord is ever on the watch.,
6008,"As for man, when his Lord tests him, and thus gives him honour and bounties, he says, “My Lord has honoured me.”",
6009,"But when he tests him, and thus straitens his provision for him, he says, “My Lord has disgraced me.”",
6010,"No! But you do not honour the orphan,",
6011,and do not encourage one another to feed the needy.,
6012,"And you devour the inheritance with a sweeping gulp,",
6013,"and love wealth, an excessive love.",
6014,"No! When the earth will be crushed thoroughly to be turned into bits,",
6015,"and your Lord will come, and the angels as well, lined up in rows,",
6016,"and Jahannam (Hell), on that day, will be brought forward, it will be the day when man will realize the truth, but from where will he take advantage of such realization?",
6017,"He will say, “O Would that I had sent ahead (some good deeds) for (this) my life!”",
6018,"So no one can punish like He will punish, that day,",
6019,nor can anyone shackle like He will shackle.,
6020,"(As for an obedient man, it will be said to him,) “O content soul,",
6021,"come back to your Lord, well-pleased, well-pleasing.",
6022,"So, enter among My (special) servants,",
6023,and enter My Paradise.”,
6024,"I swear by this city,",
6025,"-and (O Prophet,) you are going to be allowed (to fight) in this city-",
6026,"and by the father and all those he begot,",
6027,indeed We have created man (to live) in hard struggle.,
6028,Does he think that no one has power over him?,
6029,"He says, “I have spent a lot of wealth.”",
6030,Does he think that no one has seen him?,
6031,"Did We not make for him two eyes,",
6032,"and one tongue and two lips,",
6033,and showed him the two ways?,
6034,"Yet he did not make his way through the steep course,- -",
6035,- And what may let you know what the steep course is?,
6036,"(It is) freeing of the neck of a slave,",
6037,or giving food in a day of hunger,
6038,"to an orphan near of kin,",
6039,or to a needy person lying in dust- -,
6040,- then he did not join those who believe and advise each other to be patient and advise each other to be merciful.,
6041,Those are the People of the Right Hand. (i.e. their books of deeds will be given in their right hands),
6042,"As for those who reject Our verses, they are the People of the Left Hand. (i.e. their books of deeds will be given in their left hands.)",
6043,"Upon them will be the Fire, enveloping them with closed exits.",
6044,"I swear by the sun and his broad light,",
6045,"and by the moon when she follows him,",
6046,"and by the day when it shows his brightness,",
6047,"and by the night when it envelops him,",
6048,"and by the sky, and the One who built it,",
6049,"and by the earth, and the One who spread it,",
6050,"and by the soul, and the One who made it well,",
6051,"then inspired it with its (instincts of) evil and piety,",
6052,"success is really attained by him who purifies it,",
6053,and failure is really suffered by him who pollutes it.,
6054,"(The People of) Thamūd denied the truth because of their transgression,",
6055,when rose up the one who was most wretched of them.,
6056,"So, the Messenger of Allah said to them, “Be careful of Allah’s she-camel and her right to drink.”",
6057,"But they rejected him and killed her, so their Lord sent eradicating torment upon them because of their sin, and made it equal for all.",
6058,And He has no fear of its consequence.,
6059,"I swear by the night when it covers (the sun),",
6060,"and by the day when it unveils itself,",
6061,"and by the One who created the male and the female,",
6062,your efforts are diverse:,
6063,"As for the one who gives (in charity) and fears Allah,",
6064,"and believes in the best (religion),",
6065,We will facilitate for him the way to extreme ease (i.e. the comforts of Paradise).,
6066,"But the one who is miser and deems himself self-sufficient,",
6067,"and rejects the best (religion),",
6068,We will facilitate for him the way to extreme distress.,
6069,And his wealth will not help him when he will fall down (into Hell).,
6070,"Of course, it is undertaken by Us to guide,",
6071,and in Our control is the Hereafter and the worldly life.,
6072,So I have warned you of a blazing fire.,
6073,"None will enter it but the wretched one,",
6074,who rejected (the truth) and turned away (from it).,
6075,"And saved from it will be the most God-fearing one,",
6076,"who gives his wealth (in charity) to become purified,",
6077,"while no one has conferred any favour on him for which he would give a return,",
6078,"but (he gave his wealth in charity) only to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High.",
6079,And surely he will soon be happy.,
6080,"I swear by the forenoon,",
6081,"and by the night when it becomes peaceful,",
6082,"your Lord (O Prophet,) has neither forsaken you, nor has become displeased.",
6083,Surely the Hereafter is much better for you than the present life.,
6084,"And of course, your Lord will give you so much that you will be pleased.",
6085,"Did He not find you an orphan, and give you shelter?",
6086,"And He found you unaware of the way (the Sharī‘ah ), then He guided you.",
6087,"and He found you in need, then made you need-free.",
6088,"Therefore, as for orphan, do not oppress him,",
6089,"and as for the beggar, do not scold him.",
6090,"And about the bounty of your Lord, do talk.",
6091,Have We not caused your bosom to be wide open for you?,
6092,And We removed from you your burden,
6093,"that had (almost) broken your back,",
6094,and We raised high your name.,
6095,"So, undoubtedly, along with the hardship there is ease.",
6096,"Undoubtedly, along with the hardship there is ease.",
6097,"So, when you are free (from collective services), toil hard (in worship),",
6098,and towards your Lord turn with eagerness.,
6099,"I swear by the Fig and the Olive,",
6100,"and by Tūr, the mount of Sinai,",
6101,"and by this peaceful city,",
6102,"We have created man in the best composition,",
6103,"then We turned him into the lowest of the low,",
6104,"except those who believed and did righteous deeds, because for them there is a reward never ending.",
6105,"So, what can make you, after all this, to deny the Requital?",
6106,Is Allah not the Greatest Ruler of all the rulers?,
6107,"Read with the name of your Lord who created (every thing),",
6108,He created man from a clot of blood.,
6109,"Read, and your Lord is the most gracious,",
6110,who imparted knowledge by means of the pen.,
6111,He taught man what he did not know.,
6112,"In fact, man crosses the limits,",
6113,because he deems himself to be free of need.,
6114,Surely to your Lord is the return.,
6115,Have you seen him who forbids,
6116,a servant of Allah when he prays?,
6117,"Tell me, if he is on the right path,",
6118,"or bids piety, (would the former still forbid him?)",
6119,"Tell me, if he rejects (the true faith) and turns away,",
6120,does he not know that Allah is watching (him)?,
6121,"No! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag (him) by forelock,",
6122,"a lying, sinful forelock.",
6123,"So let him call the men of his council,",
6124,We will call the soldiers of the Hell.,
6125,"No! Never obey him, and bow down in sajdah, and come close to Me.",
6126,We have sent it (the Qur’ān) down in the Night of Qadr.,
6127,And what may let you know what the Night of Qadr is?,
6128,The Night of Qadr is much better than one thousand months.,
6129,"The angels and the Spirit descend in it, with the leave of your Lord, along with every command.",
6130,Peace it is till the debut of dawn.,
6131,"Those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book and the polytheists were not (expected) to desist (from their wrong beliefs) unless there comes to them a clear proof,",
6132,a messenger from Allah who recites the purified scrolls,
6133,containing (right and) straight writings.,
6134,"And those who were given the Book did not disagree but after the clear proof came to them,",
6135,"while they were not ordered but to worship Allah, making their submission exclusive for him with no deviation, and to establish Salāh and pay Zakāh. That is the way of the straight religion.",
6136,"Surely those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the fire of Jahannam , in which they will be living forever. Those are the worst of all human beings.",
6137,"As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they are the best of all human beings.",
6138,"Their reward, with their Lord, is gardens of eternity beneath which rivers flow, in which they will be abiding forever. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. That (reward) is for him who has awe of his Lord.",
6139,"When the earth will be trembled with its quake,",
6140,"and the earth will bring forth its burdens,",
6141,"and man will say, “What has happened to it?”",
6142,"That day it will describe all its happenings,",
6143,because its Lord will have so commanded it.,
6144,"That day the people will come back (from the place of reckoning) in different groups, so that they may be shown (the fruits of) their deeds.",
6145,"So, whoever does any good act (even) to the weight of a particle will see it.",
6146,And whoever does evil (even) to the weight of a particle will see it.,
6147,"(I swear) by those (horses) that run snorting,",
6148,"then those that create sparks by striking (their hoofs) on the stones,",
6149,"then those that invade at morning,",
6150,"then raise, at the same time, a trail of dust,",
6151,"then enter, at the same time, into the centre of the (opposing) host,",
6152,"man is, indeed, very ungrateful to his Lord,",
6153,"and he himself is a witness to that fact,",
6154,"and in his love for wealth, he is very intense.",
6155,"Does he not then know (what will happen) when all that is contained in the graves will be overturned,",
6156,and all that is contained in the hearts will be exposed.,
6157,"Surely your Lord, that day, is fully aware of them.",
6158,The Striking Event!,
6159,What is the Striking Event?,
6160,And what may let you know what the Striking Event is?,
6161,"(It will happen) on a day when people will be like scattered moths,",
6162,and the mountains will be like carded wool.,
6163,"Then, as for him whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy,",
6164,he will be in a happy life.,
6165,"But he whose scales are light,",
6166,-his abode will be Abyss.,
6167,And what may let you know what that (Abyss) is?,
6168,A blazing Fire!,
6169,"You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing (worldly benefits),",
6170,until you reach the graves.,
6171,No! (This is not a correct attitude.) You will soon know (the reality).,
6172,"Again, you will soon know.",
6173,No! Only if you knew (it) with a sure knowledge!,
6174,"You will certainly see the Hell,",
6175,then you will see it with full certitude.,
6176,Then you will be asked about all the pleasures (you enjoyed in the world).,
6177,"(I swear) by the Time,",
6178,"man is in a state of loss indeed,",
6179,"except those who believed and did righteous deeds, and exhorted each other to follow truth, and exhorted each other to observe patience.",
6180,"Woe to every backbiter, derider",
6181,who accumulates wealth and counts it.,
6182,He thinks that his wealth has made him eternal.,
6183,Never! He will certainly be thrown into the Crushing Fire.,
6184,And what may let you know what the Crushing Fire is?,
6185,It is Allah’s kindled fire,
6186,that will peep into the hearts.,
6187,"It will be closed on them,",
6188,in outstretched columns.,
6189,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the People of the Elephant?,
6190,Has He not turned their plan into nullity?,
6191,"And He sent upon them flying birds in flocks,",
6192,"throwing upon them stones of baked clay,",
6193,and thus He turned them into an eaten-up chaff.,
6194,"Because of the familiarity of the Quraish,",
6195,"that is, their familiarity with the trips of winter and summer,",
6196,"they must worship the Lord of this House,",
6197,"who gave them food against hunger, and gave them security against fear.",
6198,Have you seen him who denies the Requital?,
6199,"So, he is the one who pushes away the orphan,",
6200,and does not persuade (others) to feed the needy.,
6201,"So, Woe to those performers of Salāh,",
6202,"who are neglectful of their Salāh,",
6203,"who (do good only to) show off,",
6204,and refuse (to give even) small gifts.,
6205,"(O Prophet,) surely We have given to you Al-Kauthar.",
6206,"So, offer Salāh (prayer) to your Lord, and sacrifice.",
6207,Surely it is your enemy whose traces are cut off.,
6208,"Say, “O disbelievers,",
6209,"I do not worship that which you worship,",
6210,nor do you worship the One whom I worship.,
6211,"And neither I am going to worship that which you have worshipped,",
6212,nor will you worship the One whom I worship.,
6213,"For you is your faith, and for me, my faith.”",
6214,"(O Prophet,) When there comes Allah’s help and the Victory,",
6215,"and you see people entering Allah’s (approved) religion in multitudes,",
6216,"then pronounce the purity and praise of your Lord, and seek forgiveness from Him. Surely He is Ever-Relenting.",
6217,"Perish the two hands of Abū Lahab, and perish he!",
6218,"Neither his wealth benefited him, nor what he earned.",
6219,"He will soon enter a Fire, full of flames,",
6220,"and his wife as well,-the wicked carrier of firewood.",
6221,"Around her neck, there is (a collar of iron, like) a well-twisted rope.",
6222,"Say, “The truth is that Allah is One.",
6223,"Allah is Besought of all, needing none.",
6224,"He neither begot anyone, nor was he begotten.",
6225,And equal to Him has never been any one.”,
6226,"Say, “I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak",
6227,"from the evil of everything He has created,",
6228,"and from the evil of the dark night when it penetrates,",
6229,"and from the evil of the women who blow on the knots,",
6230,and from the evil of an envier when he envies.,
6231,"Say, “I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind,",
6232,"the King of mankind,",
6233,"the God of mankind,",
6234,"from the evil of the whisperer who withdraws (when Allah’s name is pronounced),",
6235,"the one who whispers in the hearts of people,",
6236,whether from among the Jinn or Mankind.,
